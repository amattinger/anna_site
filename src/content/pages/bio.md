All the major threads of my life have traced an odyssean circle.

In my teens, drawn to physics, anthropology, linguistics, and so on—stunted, upon graduation, by the paradox of choice—I decided to take six months to clear my head in the backcountry of Kings Canyon National Park, building segments of the Pacific Crest Trail at 13,000 feet. After that, I figured, I'd think about a vocation.

That six months turned into a decade.

I freelanced my way around the world. I'd do seasonal gigs [as a ski instructor, bodyworker, farmhand, pyrotechnician, drystone mason] and one-offs [as a tech evangelist, beet piler, writer, heavy machinery operator]—but modeling was my mainstay.

Once or twice a year, I'd plan a whirlwind tour where, for a few months, I'd get all my solitude and much of my sleep in airports and train stations. I posed atop double-decker buses in Hong Kong, in ornate bat-infested ruins outside Havana, in the waves near Hobart. From the other side of the lens, I watched the creative processes of thousands of photographers, honing my aesthetic discernment over time.

Eventually I circled back to formal study, enrolling in online community college STEM courses before transferring to Stanford to study Computer Science. But while interviewing for tech jobs as a new grad, a friend asked me to photograph her maternity session. That job—the before, during, and after; the logistics, the dynamism, the experimentation, the celebratory intimacy—felt alive and fulfilling in a way few things have.

Before that shoot, I'd always assumed I love photography too much to risk doing it for money. Turns out I love it too much not to.

Drawn to the luxuriantly feral, experiential, conceptual, and human. Based in San Francisco; available for projects worldwide.
