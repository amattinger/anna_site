    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For weeks now I've repeated, like a broken record, the same phrase to whomever's asked me how I'm doing: \"About to fly to Bangkok with a one-way ticket.\" Each time, the words emerged automatically; meanwhile, I was catatonic, not registering the words that were fast becoming my own personal fucking catchphrase.<br><br>Really, that's not an answer to the question&nbsp;<em>How are you doing?</em>&nbsp;but everyone I've said it to has accepted it as such.<br><br>This is the last time I'm stating it, but this time I'm at least half-conscious of my words: I'm flying to Bangkok in a little over twelve hours...and that's basically the extent of my itinerary thus far.<br><br>As my departure's been arriving, a lot of people I've caught up with or run into--mainly acquaintances or bygone friends from a past life I no longer relate to--keep saying things to me like, \"I wish I could just get up and go like you, by the seat of your pants, caution to the wind, [insert cliche after cliche here]--you're so fearless/free-spirited/bohemian.\" Or whatever.<br><br>They couldn't be farther from the truth.<br><br>I'd like to officially come out: By default, I'm actually pretty fucking neurotic. I overthink, overanalyze, overspeculate on worst-case scenarios. My natural tendency is to swing between being a control freak, and being opportunistically lazy. I am aeons away from being inherently free from fear and anxiety.<br><br>A very select few close friends of mine know this all too well; on the other hand, my acquaintances tend to invent a persona for me that I generally haven't bothered to disillusion them from because--I'll admit--the persona is pretty flattering. However, it's a fucking facade, and after a long-ass while being adulated [and even iconized] on false pretenses got me feeling pretty worn-down. It's that whole&nbsp;<em>it's worse to be loved for what you're not than hated for what you are</em>&nbsp;platitude-majigg, incarnate. This incongruence was a large factor behind my compulsively deactivating my Facebook a while ago [which I've just now reactivated, after the persuasive barrages of a couple friends--given that I'm traveling without a phone, and with a camera].<br><br>Now, presenting the reason I'm writing all of this:<br><br>By birth, I'm chickenshit. That's not meant to be self-deprecating; rather, the thing I've just realized is that&nbsp;<em>that's kind of the whole fucking&nbsp;point.</em><br><br>Listen. On my first solo road trip, I scraped together $900 and left my credit/debit cards behind. I packed my car with a sleeping bag, climbing shoes, and a couple cans of soup left over from my winter supply. That was to last me through three months of driving a vague loop from Tahoe down to San Diego, up to Vancouver, then back down to Tahoe.<br><br>It should be obvious to anyone with the faintest grasp of American gas prices, cost of living, and geography that $900 was not even remotely in the vicinity of being almost enough for such a trip. I had no jobs lined up, and no firm plans of where I'd stay along the way.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Call it poor planning, but I did that on purpose. It forced me to have a better time than I ever could have had if I'd taken the precautions of responsible planning and budgeting, if I'd been able to buffer myself in creature comforts, if I'd been able to maintain all the same habits.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Why? Because doing so was the only way to finally quell the unfounded fear, anxiety, and paranoia that had been plaguing me all winter.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To use an excerpt from an email I wrote an old friend the other night, featuring the exact moment this realization of my own behavior and motivations suddenly hit me:</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>My winter's similarly been a succession of catalyzing shaker-uppers. Lots of out-of-nowhere encounters [with people, but also other things--books, experiences, coincidences] that have propelled me to be introspective in a productive way, rather than \"introspective\" in that punishing, paralyzing, depressed way...which I don't think is true introspection to begin with. I think true introspection might lead you down dark passageways, but eventually comes full circle back out into the light--a brighter, cleaner light than whatever you'd been basking in before.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Blah, blah, figurative language. Metaphors and shit.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Anyway, you're welcome? Not really, though--I mean, not that you're not welcome, but it was a symbiotic exchange. I've been learning about myself from all my interactions this winter, too--in gauging how I react to different questions or situations, in gauging what feelings emerge or linger when I'm alone again after the interaction is over. It's interesting. I've dug up a lot of old ghosts from the past [ranging from casual acquaintances...to closet-skeletons].</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>This winter's been existential boot camp for me. Asking myself a lot of unhealthy questions, dealing with unwarranted anxiety and depression. [Granted, who's to say when those things are and are not warranted? Are they ever warranted? Are they ever not? What does anything mean? AHHHH!]&nbsp;</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Then I climbed out. The boy went away, so that I'd be left alone to make sure I was standing on two feet and empowering myself [rather than turning to the comforts of a partner to use as a crutch and distract me from myself--knowing him makes me wiser]. I pulled out my fucking IUD, which had never even occurred to me as a culprit. I started tackling one important task at a time, instead of overwhelming myself with several and being reduced to arresting procrastination. I went outside. I woke up earlier. Then I started meeting up with people I hadn't seen in a long, long time--and seeing myself reflected in ways that I denied at first, resentful [\"they're just projecting some idealized archetype onto me, rather than simply seeing me\"], and then later accepted as facets of truth. Just because a perspective is dissimilar--and incomplete--doesn't mean it's ALL wrong. I mean, it's limited, embellished, but so is everything--we limit things so they'll be simple, and embellish them so they'll be memorable. And even if the projection seems too lofty, the answer isn't resentment--or big-headedness--it's comparative self-evaluation of the other person's projection of me...and then converting it into a challenge, or an inspiration.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Anyway, that's what my own internal process for this winter looks like. Letting go of arbitrary fear.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>In all honesty: as much practice I've had in chasing uncertainty [and I've had a lot of fucking practice in the last few years], it still scares the steaming shit out of me every time I walk up to the precipice.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>However, I know from experience that--once I jump--the fear becomes obsolete, and all that's left is adrenaline and a sense of infinity.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>[This is literal, too: One of my best ways of getting myself out of a depressive funk is to go jump into a cold body of water--ideally an ocean, lake, or river, at night, in winter. And when I get out of the water, I feel so alive and not at all cold. The initial apprehension is there every single time, and never even really diminishes--but as I keep logging mileage doing this same pointless thing countless times, I become more and more assured of how I'm going to feel, once I get it over with, by a deeper knowledge that beats off my instincts to back down. It's my own version of practicing/cultivating something like faith.]</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>So, a month ago I worried about mosquito prevention, worst-case scenarios, theft, issues at the border, being targeted by the police, running out of money...I even thought about all the things I could put my money towards, or all the work I could get, or things I could do, if only I chose to cancel the trip and stay in the States.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>The closer it gets--the more of an inevitability it becomes--the more relaxed I feel. I get this sort of zen-like resignation. I'm packing next to nothing, and I know once I get through airport security, I'm going to feel like I've finally returned home. That warm narcotic-orgasmic-bracing relief of tension I didn't even know I'd been carrying.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>It never, ever feels like that's going to happen before the fact, but I know from experience to have faith because that's&nbsp;always&nbsp;what happens.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Incidentally, this is why I only buy non-refundable plane tickets: because I know myself well enough to know that, if I allow myself an easy way out, I'll end up taking it. I have to trick myself, all the time--not only with traveling, but with more mundane things [like studying, exercising, working, errands, hygiene--anything requiring discipline, which is something I decidedly do&nbsp;not&nbsp;have a natural-occurring supply of].</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Tricks...I have to leave myself no easy way out, or make things into a game, or make it so that I'd have someone to answer to&nbsp;should&nbsp;I back out--where I'd lose face or let someone down by doing so.&nbsp;</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>Some people seem to be easily self-motivated, or truly fearless. Lately people keep making the mistake of thinking I'm one of those people. Not even close. In truth, I am as lazy and cowardly as the next person. I just don't let my laziness and cowardice get the best of me--I corner myself until I have no choice but to act constructively.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tonight, I sat on the roof of my old house with Alex. We were silent for a while.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"I'm nervous.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"<em>I'm</em>&nbsp;nervous.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"That's why we're&nbsp;<em>going</em>, though.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Exactly.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It's not just about questing for adventure because it's fun [though that's obviously a big part of it]. If I was&nbsp;<em>actually</em>&nbsp;fearless, and living exactly the way that I do, it'd be gratuitous. I'd just be wanking my ego, over and over, resulting in weak thrills, at best. There'd be no rush, no challenge, and most importantly, no growth.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I have no use for a stagnant life--even if that life appears on the outside to be rife with extreme sports and strange encounters. Nothing disturbs me more than meeting someone with a life that appears full and rich and surreal, only to find that they've become desensitized and adopt a too-cool-for-school attitude towards everything in the entire world--that is, towards their own existence. It disgusts me, even. They do all this cool shit, meet all these people, but have nothing to live for: philosophical zombies in glamorous packaging.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A couple days ago a girl asked me, \"Why Thailand?\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Well, not just Thailand. Not sure where else I might be going from there.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Yeah, but why&nbsp;<em>Thailand</em>, in particular? As your first stop.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"Because it was cheaper than New Zealand, and more of a departure from what I know.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"That doesn't answer my question, though.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"...Doesn't it?\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thailand's got nothing to do with this trip, really.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The&nbsp;<em>ultimate</em>&nbsp;reason I'm going is unknown to me, of course: if I already knew my reason for going on this trip, then I wouldn't need to bother going.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More generally, the reason I do what I do is because I'm not a philosophical zombie yet, and this trip is just one of succession self-inoculations against becoming one.</p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Bangkok, Thailand</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Life is full--yesterday morning felt like five days ago. I've learned a lot so far. Mainly, that I'm far less worldly than I thought, but also far more resourceful.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So, I know the airport in Taipei probably doesn't seem like the first thing I should start extolling the virtues of, but I'm going to anyway [revealing straightaway my conspicuous lack of worldliness].<br><br>We had a layover there and I was almost sad to leave. That airport is a veritable fucking theme park; I was laughing my entire time there. When we showed up to our gate, it was decorated with Chinese brush painting on the walls, overhanging lamps masquerading as paper lanterns, am expensive-looking fake frog pond made of glass. The gate had a name, even. Underneath the facade of a traditional wooden roof a sign read, \"Taiwan Image.\" I thought this was cute.<br><br>Then I wandered down the corridor. Next door was the gate \"Postal Waiting Room\", guarded by a fat penguin-looking postal worker that reeked&nbsp;<em>Sanrio,&nbsp;</em>a flock of airmail-envelope-paper-planes taking flight over wavy upholstered blue benches. Another was book themed, stocked with several shelves of free books. Another was Hello Kitty themed, complete with a playplace and rainbow amphitheater. Another looked like a room in a museum, full of Taiwanese ceremonial artifacts sitting pretty behind glass and plaques.<br><br>Amidst the shops were eerie fake living room displays: a mantle, lamp, mid-game pool table, upholstered furniture, and picture-framed screen looping the same commercial over and over promoted Glenlivet in a display of charming overkill. Random aesthetic sanctuaries dotted the corridor: a room full of flower arrangements in which one could unwind from any in-transit anxiety. Amidst the icons for \"Restroom\" and \"Smoking lounge\" was a kneeling figure, which directed one to the prayer room. All the airport staff looked like dolls that had just come out of their shrink wrap--many were in silly costumes [especially those working near the Hello Kitty gate], standing as still as members of the Queen's Guard, and their hair and makeup was done up to a degree of perfection I rarely see in the states [on the men as well as the women].<br><br>The \"Green Relaxing Room\" cracked me up the most--in it were several life-sized dioramas of the jungle or beach, complete with backdrops, fake rocks and trees, and sand. I forced Alex to indulge me in taking fake tourist photos in front of these, much to the amusement of other foreigners passing by.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418297774818-YXGCEMSJ4VZI3573EWDT/9.jpg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Relativity</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Upon our 3:00a.m. arrival, everything we'd been told to expect was acted out for us in real-time, which made me feel like we were navigating through a video game after reading how to beat it. I'd been given instructions on exactly what to do, which was lucky because I was far too tired to think for myself.&nbsp;<br><br>Customs was so quick and easy that we didn't realize we'd already passed through it.<br><br>Immediately, \"discount\" taxi drivers tried to chivvy us into their cars--I'd been told this would happen, and that I should ignore them. We headed down to the lower level and got a cab. The driver asked to see my taxi receipt, which in addition to the location information is also the only way I can keep track of the driver and send in a complaint if he tries to rip us off, and tried to pocket it--as I'd been told he might. As soon as we were in the car, he tried to haggle a fixed fare with me--I'd been told not to oblige, no matter how good the offer sounded [he started at 500 baht for a 37 km ride--about $15 for 23 miles].<br><br>\"No. Meter, please.\" After a bit of insisting that a flat fare would actually be cheaper for me, he reluctantly turned on the meter. Once we arrived, the cab fare--<em>after</em>&nbsp;the airport tax and two tolls--was about $9.<br><br>Andrew, a photographer I'd worked with back in Reno had comped us a hotel for our first two nights in Bangkok, since we were planning to shoot in Pattaya. When we stumbled into the lobby, it took me several minutes to realize that he was standing right there next to the concierge, and had been waiting.<br><br>\"About time you got here!\"<br><br>\"Yeah...what is it, 4 a.m.? My brain's pretty fried. So when are you heading to Pattaya?\"<br><br>\"Well. I'm leaving town today.\"<br><br>\"Today? Change of plans? I thought you'd be here until at least the 22nd.\"<br><br>\"Today is the 22nd.\"<br><br>I laughed deliriously at this, but his face didn't change.<br><br>\"...Wait, what?\"<br><br>\"I booked your room from the 20th-22nd, since you said your flight got in early morning of the 21st. That was yesterday.\"<br><br>\"...Wait.\" My jet lag-addled brain exploded. \"...Fuck...ah. Fuck...? Shit. Wait...\"<br><br>Lesson one: Don't blindly trust the flight itinerary at the expense of common sense. [Or, more generally, double-check things.] Apparently...just because the arrival <em>time</em>&nbsp;has been adjusted, doesn't mean the date has.<br><br><strong>Citichic&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Luckily for us, Andrew was extremely generous [despite his obvious and completely justified annoyance] and had already bought us an extra night. He showed us to our room--it was exceedingly trendy. All the fixtures and furniture seemed to scream, \"Look how excessively fucking modern we are!\" There were two different showerheads, and a sliding pervert-door in case someone in the bedroom wanted to look into the bathroom. We had robes and our own backyard patio, canopied in tropical trees I'd never seen before, with fruits that looked like strings of anal beads.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418297839568-Y2DPBT19I7P1S8OAX391/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My guilt was overshadowed only by my exhaustion. Andrew told us to get an hour or two of sleep and to meet him for breakfast at the Radisson at 6:30--and that I shouldn't be too overwrought with guilt, because the room [which would easily be several hundred dollars a night in America] was about $40/night.<br><br>We did, and when I mentioned making it up to him and heading to Pattaya, he seemed undecided and gave no clear answers. However, he was quite cheerful, and told us all about the most recent local scams and political unrest, and what tourist traps to avoid. As we left, he told us to have a good time and vaguely inferred that I should keep abreast-ish of my emails.<br><br>Incidentally, I'm writing all of this from one of the computers at CitiChic; it's a gorgeous morning and we're about to check out and head to a Couchsurfing host's place and I don't know when I'll next have a keyboard at my disposal. Alex is running around, making sure we have potable water and looking into taking a water taxi.<br><br><strong>First-Day Acclimation</strong><br><br>In the morning we opted to run around, rather than crash out and exacerbate our jet lag. Arbitrarily we chose Lomphini Park as a more-or-less destination, since it'd give us a direction to go in, which can be a tough thing to settle on when there's really nowhere at all one needs to be.<br><br>No American city I've been to is as densely overstimulating as Bangkok--so full of color and noise and fast-moving activity. On the streets were countless vendors constantly either selling food or getting ready for the next rush; motorcycle taxis zipped around with well-to-do clients sitting sidesaddle behind them. Several times, I nearly stepped on someone or crossed a busy street without realizing. New York might as well be a desolate expanse. Las Vegas, Oakland, San Francisco, New Orleans--all quiet and sparse.&nbsp;<br><br>The instant we set out the door, the cacophonous bustle grabbed us in a chokehold: stampedes of motorcyclists cutting corners as if they were already shitfaced at 9a.m.; cars driving all over the wrong lanes and crooked sidewalks; a stray dog sleeping in a bed of tied-off trash bags; a horde of about twelve rats clearly having a momentous shindig behind a vacant food stall; massive clumps of telephone wires sagging overhead, tied together spaghetti-esque with no seeming rhyme or reason. From these clumps of wires I heard a loud buzzing: the sound of something arcing.<br><br>\"That's not really a sound we're supposed to hear,\" Alex said mildly. Nonetheless, the buzzing exerted its recurring presence in our day, which we found amusing. Granted, we were in a bit of a stupor and found everything amusing; for several minutes we stood and anthropomorphized a group of pigeons, dubbing over their pigeon-talk. We walked by several construction workers in bandana-balaclavas who were using metal grinders and saws right in the middle of the sidewalk, which inspired us to make a string of OSHA jokes that wouldn't have been funny to anyone else.<br><br>Lesson two: In Bangkok, the first phrase one should learn isn't \"Hello,\" \"Thank you,\" \"You're welcome,\"&nbsp;<br>\"Discount?\" or \"No problem,\" all of which I'd gone ahead and committed to memory.&nbsp;<br><br>In fact, it's \"No, thank you,\" the one no-brainer phrase that hadn't occurred to me to learn.<br><br>Within five minutes, we'd been approached by every type of would-be scanner that we'd been warned about: congenial and well-dressed men pretending to recognize us from somewhere, women with clipboards trying to get us in on a contest, taxi and tuk-tuk drivers trying to coax us into their vehicles, calling after us in ceaseless succession that we looked lost and that they could help us.<br><br>Again, it felt like a video game: they all fit their character roles so perfectly, and my responses were such to-the-letter reenactments of advice I'd been given. Sensory overload notwithstanding, it was pretty fun, and while my perma-smile was borne of insomniac delirium and cultural pressure [in Thailand one's expected to smile, even--and especially--during less comfortable interactions], it was sincere.<br><br>Third lesson: learning the Thai alphabet [or printing it out and carrying it around] would've been a lot more helpful than learning basic phrases and numbers, since Thai people all know how to say those things in English, anyway. But several street and station signs aren't spelled out in English--it's tough to know how to ask for directions when you don't even know where it is you're trying to get to [and Google maps gave us all street names in the Thai alphabet].<br><br>Still, after not too long, I'd figured out how to read some of the Thai signs by context, and we made it to Skytrain, which was extremely navigable and thankfully devoid of tourist-predating scammers and taxi drivers.<br><br><strong>Street Food</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Once off BTS, we wandered down a main road and were pulled into several detours by our noses over the next couple hours. Down extremely narrow alleys would be large markets full of street vendors that were completely hidden from the main roads.<br><br>The marketplaces were bustling, sometimes with seemingly hundreds of people, yet we were the&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>non-locals at any of them. We took this as a good sign. Several of the stalls had pre-established local prices and we'd watch what they charged the locals; no one tried to overcharge or up-sell us. In fact, for the first time since we'd been outdoors in Bangkok, the locals treated us with courteous indifference; no one batted an eye or tried to coax us into buying anything.&nbsp;<br><br>I grew up on traditional Asian food a la my mother and grandma, and been to several Thai restaurants in America--but the majority of food being sold on the street was completely new to us. We couldn't even discern most of the ingredients.<br><br>Case in point: the first thing we ate. I can best describe it as \"deep-fried seaweed-and-or-shallot jello cubes\" that we supposed might have been derived from beans. Or dough. Or something else.<br><br>Throughout the day, we also ate some sweet taro-blob-fried-corn things; a rice dish with egg yolks, peanuts, mushrooms, taro paste, and some yellow legume-like things; sweet-and-savory corn-taro-and-maybe-some-type-of-squash blobs; lotus root juice [YES]; spicy fish balls; some amazing \"milk pudding\" with kidney beans, pudding jelly, and some firm jelloid cubes with one of the most interesting textures of anything I've eaten; an ice cream slushie thing with coconut milk, peanuts, rice, and some gooey white things that I thought at first might have been some kind of fruit, but weren't; squid kebabs;&nbsp;<em>real</em>&nbsp;pad thai [which I didn't even recognize as pad thai at first]...<br><br>Summarily, we ate a lot. With everything costing between 10-40 baht [$0.30-1.20], another street stall every two feet, and an incentive to support smaller businesses off the main tourist drag, the only limiting factor was the capacities of our stomachs.<br><br>Also, fun fact: Red Bull originally came from Thailand [with a similar logo]. However, the Thai version is sort of syrupy [less fruity], uncarbonated, and even<em>more</em>&nbsp;caffeinated.<br><br>Of course, we got one of those [for about $0.20].&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Lumphini Park</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Eventually we reached Lumphini. It wasn't what I expected--full of streams and bridges and grass and a smattering of pretty old traditional buildings and monuments, but with roads still cutting through it every now and again as a constant reminder that, yes, we're still in the city. I sort of liked this frenetic aspect, personally--it felt more juxtaposed to be hanging out by a pretty pond while, right over yonder, chaos was still ensuing without me. Several people in casual business attire were taking naps under trees and in the grass.<br><br>Throughout the day, we opted not to take photos [\"What would we photograph? I could take a picture of just about&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;we've seen today; I'd rather just live it than attempt to capture it all.\"] but I caved when I saw a&nbsp;<em>huge&nbsp;</em>monitor lizard eating some large crow-or-other-corvid like it was a large insect [unfortunately, none of these turned out--I couldn't get close enough].<br><br>Alex, having seen several monitor lizards himself in Australia, laughed at me. \"Those things are everywhere--they're like squirrels.\" Squirrels, except the size of dogs and with necrosis-inducing venom. Over the next hour, we probably saw over ten of them--and minus one small boy who was throwing a stick at one, the locals seemed indifferent to their presence.<br><br>Still, even he was impressed when we saw one about six feet long that appeared to be morbidly obese. We guessed it probably weighed about ninety pounds at the very least.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418297915428-LCK53XA0JP8COUK42FR9/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Along with the lizards, we saw several bird species and plants we'd never seen before. Several beautiful stray dogs ran around [\"Well, when they're surviving on their own, the useless traits get weeded out pretty quick--you're not going to see stray pugs, or purebreds at all, really.\"] and the ponds were full of nearly human-sized catfish that were mostly hidden under the murky surface. I coined several dumb new portmanteaus [dalmigeon, bushlephants, hearchways...].<br><br>We also came across several protester campgrounds--tent villages blasting heated speeches in Thai. I resisted the urge to go ask them questions.<br><br>At one point, I thought I saw a long blue-gray tongue flicker out of one of the holes in a manhole cover. Alex laughed at me and said I was being ridiculous.<br><br>Five minutes later, we saw a giant monitor lizard--maybe a five-footer--squeeze clumsily out of a crack in the street that looked like it was about two inches wide.<em>[So there!]</em><br><br><em>Ack, it's almost check-out time, so I'll skip a few things and wrap this up.&nbsp;</em><br><br><strong>Platinum Fashion Mall</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When giving us recommendations, Andrew had insisted that we visit the Platinum Fashion Mall. Neither of us are much for shopping--or clothes, period--but he insisted.<br><br>That mall was easily one of the most surreal [and claustraphobia-inducing] places I'd been in my life--an endless labyrinth with aisles four feet wide, with walls made up of tiny shopfronts. We took an escalator from the street to get inside its fifth floor, and then got lost several times, I finally reached a directory and discovered that there were four floors of&nbsp;<em>just</em>&nbsp;women's clothing. It seemed impossible. The place was so big and dizzying--and had so much of&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;conceivable garment in the Universe--that I figured it'd be completely impossible to ever actually find any particular item you might go looking for. A good percentage of the patrons were dolled-up ladyboys, another sizeable portion were foreigners. Also, shit was&nbsp;<em>cheap</em>--having packed virtually no clothes for my trip [just the T-shirt and pants I'd worn on the plane], I bought a couple things, all priced between $1-6 after haggling [and $6 was for items arguably crossing into \"high-end\" territory].<br><br>It felt like a really weird dream, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't become exceedingly anxious in small crowded spaces.<br><br><strong>Southern Style Thai Massage</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So, I'm trained in Thai massage myself, having completed programs in both Northern Style and Nerve Touch Style in the States.<br><br>I'd asked my instructor about Southern Style, and she'd said, \"It's similar to Northern Style, but a lot faster and harder and more aggressive--but not necessarily beneficial or therapeutic, like Nerve Touch. Pretty much any time you hear someone had a scary experience getting Thai massage, or an injury, it was a Southern Style massage.\"<br><br>\"So...you're saying Southern Style is basically a shitty version of the same thing, rather than a style on its own?\"<br><br>\"Well, I suppose so.\"<br><br>I thought she was just biased. So we got massages in Bangkok.<br><br>I enjoyed it--it's tough for me to&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;enjoy a massage--but it was still easily the worst Thai massage I'd ever gotten. The therapist's sense of safe alignment was egregious, and a few times I was scared she was legitimately going to mis-align my back or tweak my knees.<br><br>Still...an hour-long massage for $5?...I really can't complain. However, I'll probably wait until we head up closer to Chiang Mai before trying another one.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Checking out</strong><br><br>Phew. I woke up this morning [first legitimate night of sleep in days]. Wanted to clear my head this morning by writing all this shit down while I've got a free computer at my disposal. Also, I'm nostalgic, but forget everything if I don't eke out enough discipline to transcribe it.<br><br>There was a lot of other cool stuff that I don't have time to go into--on our walk back to the hotel, in addition to the night markets, we passed by several old VW hippie vans along the street that had been converted to portable bars, with built-in counters and sidewalk bar stools, pimped out with squillions of lasers and blinky Christmas lights and blasting electronic music. They looked like something out of Burning Man.<br><br>But it's time to get off my ass and go--we're going to stay with an American ex-pat we found via Couchsurfing.<br><br>Next after that...Alex wants to head south to the islands and then Malaysia, and I want to go north and on to Indochina. So we're going to flip a coin.</p>\n</div>",

The change in scenery gave us perspective on where we'd just come from. Our hotel</span><em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">had been in the middle of a clump of fancy resorts, profoundly congested with thousands of tourists of the grumpy-wealthy-sedentary-American ilk, and particular locals who hung out there putting on acts expressly in hope of ripping off ignorant honeymooners. [It was later mentioned to us that Nana is one of the most debaucherous/loud/tourist-heavy/hooker-heavy areas in Bangkok.]</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This new neighborhood, while far from remote, felt more like real life: less flashy, less fantasy-oriented. People went about their own business, indifferent to us for the most part.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418296722110-SX9PBNNBOTYC4MGPG0K2/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Apparently we've been adjusting, too, without consciously trying to do so. Each time we walked down the same route from our hotel to the Nana BTS station, fewer scammers and drivers took notice of us, and the ones that did seemed less convicted and persistent. By the time we headed out for good yesterday morning, maybe one person half-heartedly tried to beckon us for a ride. We took this as a sign that we're looking less overwhelmed and disoriented by the outside observer.&nbsp;[Also, we've gotten far better at crossing the busier streets that look like drunken-NASCAR-rush-hour all the time, which have no traffic lights or stop signs to quell the congested flow of insane drivers.]</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Siam Protests</strong></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We arrived at Terrance's place, a sixth-floor condo in a nice complex with two large swimming pools. He wasn't at home, but his roommate Jones was--a dude from San Francisco staying in Bangkok for a month during a year-long traveling stint.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Arbitrarily, Alex and I decided to head to the water taxi and see where it took us. We had to transfer at the Siam station, and had heard there were a couple large malls at which we could buy a few things we [a prepaid SIM card, a map, a money belt, a pair of long pants so Alex could visit the temples without causing offense...].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">After wandering disoriented around the malls [just when we thought we'd adjusted to the chaos of Bangkok, here we were completely unable to figure out what direction we'd just come from again], we decided to head down to the street, where a huge marketplace was set up that seemed to stretch on for miles--looking down from an overpass, we couldn't see either end of the it.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Walking around in it, buying more strange and amazing street food [my favorite was a dessert thing that looked like a blob of green jello stuck to a pancake, but was probably made of mung bean], and started noticing a lot of the protest activity ramping up. Hundreds of stalls were selling cheap accessories like whistles and headbands garnished with red, white, and blue [colors of the Thai flag], as well as T-shirts all emblazoned with some variation of, \"Shutdown Bangkok, Restart Thailand.\" Uniformed officials directed people through gateways set up throughout the marketplace, and as we sat down to eat a thing of rice-and-so-on, a parade began to stomp through the street. The apocalyptic drums were soon drowned out by whistling--it seemed everyone there had bought cheap whistles and were huffing into them gleefully.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Having read about it in the news, we'd asked Andrew about it over breakfast the other day.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Oh, they're protesting against having elected officials running Thailand.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"...What? Are you sure that's what they're protesting? Or that's the whole story? That seems pretty counterintuitive.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"As far as I know, yeah.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Has there been any violence?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Only from the terrorists,\" his son chipped in.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Who?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"I don't know, but apparently there's terrorist involvement of some kind.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This didn't satisfy me.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Question one: Figure out what the protests are actually about.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Later, as Alex and I sat watching the parade in Siam, one thing struck us. \"Things seem so much more civil. If this happened in the States there'd already be cops and teargas; protestors over there aren't even allowed to use mics to amplify their voices.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"I have a hard time believing these are crazy radicals protesting for an oligarchy. They just seem like college kids and middle-class whoevers.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Kind of put things our own country in perspective.</span><br /><br /><strong>Water Taxi and Wat Arun</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We took a water taxi down the river. Essentially like a subway, but on a very fast boat in the water, with open sides that let in the view and the breeze. At each stop, the boat would slam violently into the dock, which was cushioned by the impact by a row of old tires. On the way we passed dilapidated neighborhoods with trees growing through the buildings, being taken back by nature; extremely swanky resorts on the waterfront; and several magnificent temples.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We got out at the Wat Arun stop, which we'd been told that morning was worth a visit, and took another small boat to get to the other side of the river.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418296808005-R2Z7P4SFQ8QTJIODC0N8/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Architecturally, it was stunning--and much larger than I expected it to be. However, I was disappointed in a sense. Upon entering, we walked past several cutouts for tourists to take photos behind and stalls selling kitschy Buddhist trinkets. A few extremely loud European bros skipped gaily by.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"This...is so touristy.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Well, of course it is.&nbsp;<em>We're&nbsp;</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">tourists, too.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"I know that, but...I don't know. What about the actual Thais who regard their temples as sacred spaces rather than spectacles for the amusement of foreigners? Do they even bother&nbsp;<em>going</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;to these temples--they charge admission at the door. That <em>can't</em></span><em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">apply to actual Thais...?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Here we were, having read up on all the proper temple etiquette in advance, all our limbs covered, really concerned about being respectful visitors...in the company of loud whooping-dancing-yelling Eurobros, and girls in tiny tank tops and short shorts. Maybe it was an off-day, but we saw virtually no Thais other than the monks.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Question two: How relevant are the temples to modern life in Bangkok? How do the Thais here feel about their temples [indifferent, proud, annoyed]?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Well, I guess we didn't have to worry so much about buying you those pants...\" Which was good, because amidst a sea of thousands of clothes vendors, we hadn't found any that were suitable.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We decided to wander off into the side streets, and wound up in a quieter part of the city.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">There were ten squillion cats in the place. I hadn't noticed cats before, and wondered if it was a temple thing [later realizing that, no, there are just thirty trillion stray cats on every block of the city—stray cats wandering into shops and sitting on tables while people are eating, indifferent to them].</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418296896271-QSO278CJ1ZVIZOZ10E81/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I took some photos on the way. A few little girls were dancing to some poppy music. They started giggling and waving at me so I took a picture. A grown man noticed this, and asked me if I wanted to pose for a picture&nbsp;</span><em>with</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;them and I declined, a bit weirded out [especially since I had no idea what relation, if any, this man had to the little girls]. A few minutes later I passed by them again--the girls had relocated to a more visible area, and there was a hat in front of them that the man had placed there--probably an opportunistic move inspired by my own picture-taking a few moments ago. The girls were about five or six, and a couple of them seemed really enthusiastic about dancing for a crowd, but one stood in the middle a bit awkwardly, clearly dancing because she'd been told to.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418296931998-ICMREZVO8VWDE61UQP79/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Not quite sure how to feel about that.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Also. I've been getting eaten alive.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Before heading out on my trip, I was bombarded with advice on how to prevent mosquitoes, and people kept stressing the importance of doing so. Wear Deet, sleep in a net,&nbsp;</span><em>wear</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;a net, wear long sleeves, don't go out after dark, burn mosquito coils, etc. Blah, blah, blah.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Truth be told, I'm not paranoid about such things back in the states, and I didn't come here in order to become paranoid.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Anyway, no one here seems to be getting bitten, and bug spray doesn't seem to be widely sold at the corner marts and so on; I haven't met anyone who bothered with it, nor with a lot of the other bits of advice [like wearing long sleeves and pants]. Granted, in Bangkok, malaria's not really an issue--but in more remote areas I might start to get a little more worried if I'm still getting bitten as often as I am now [oddly, Alex has been bite-free...and usually mosquitoes never bother me]. And there's Dengue everywhere, Bangkok and otherwise.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Question three: What do people&nbsp;</span><em>here</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;[or in rural areas, more so] actually do about mosquitoes?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Afterwards, we ran into Jones on our way home, and as we all stood dazedly watching a street vendor make us these strange omelette-crepe-doughy-somethings with condensed milk, he told us about an awesome cheap massage place he'd discovered, and mentioned he'd grabbed a couple business cards, so Alex and I decided to go get worked on. The massage was far better than the one we'd gotten the previous day [and about the same price], but the experience was strange, for several reasons I won't go into...though I found it pretty hilarious when the woman working on me decided to take a phone call during our session, and sat there on the phone for five minutes with her hand on my knee.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This involved walking through more protests--a big camp-out in the street, where people were blowing excitedly into whistles as they listened to speeches made by a man on a huge screen. The whole thing seemed really organized, even mellow, and people seemed to be enjoying themselves. At least the right to peaceful assembly's alive and well&nbsp;<em>somewhere.</em></span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418296966033-1Z41EIATZ2ZV341SI8CE/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Conversation with Terrance</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In the evening we met our host, Terrance, and had a brief conversation. He was a tough character to read, but clearly intelligent and inquisitive. Originally from Florida, he's been living here for about a year and a half, teaching music and other things to kids in the area and working as a route-setter at the nearby climbing gym.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I asked him about the protests and he gave me a full spiel on all he'd found out by talking to the local Thais. It was actually really fascinating [and also convinced Alex and I that we might want to get the hell out of Bangkok soon, as cool as it is].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Here's a condensed summary, because I found it extremely interesting:</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Basically, there's this guy, Taksin, who used to be the Prime Minister. He was pretty popular for a while, but is currently in exile on charges of corruption and so on. So his sister was elected in his place [Thailand's first female PM], but everyone knows she's basically a puppet that he's acting through from afar--almost a \"remote dictator\".</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Taksin's also been losing more and more favor [since some more rural/conservative people in the North still like him] for other reasons: none of Thailand's rice farmers have been paid in over a year, since he had this idea of hoarding all the country's rice in order to create a global scarcity, and then bring rice back in five years and charge a lot more for it [thinking, mistakenly, that Thailand had a monopoly on the world's rice supply], and now the government is bankrupt and there's just a ton of rice in silos, and a lot of rice farmers who once supported him are on their way to Bangkok to join in the protests.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">He also created an incentive program where anyone who purchased a car would be given a 100,000 baht rebate [which also expedited the government's bankruptcy]--as if Bangkok didn't have enough cars already--and this has increased pollution in the city. Even the people who went and bought cars feel that the government really should've been focusing on public transportation--the current BTS is so expensive that only rich people, expats, and tourists use it [\"Yeah, just so you guys know--if there's two of you, it's pretty much</span><em>&nbsp;always</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;a lot cheaper to take a cab, unless you get a day pass and are using the train six or more times that day\"].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The protesters, mainly educated middle-class liberals, are against an upcoming election because they know the election's going to be rigged, and won't really be a democratic process. The election's coming up in February, and people are trying to push it back and stop it from happening.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The protests themselves are really peaceful [there are even events coordinators and companies that have been hired out to provide TV screens and sound systems--it's almost like a festival], but recently there've been some third-party terrorist attacks on the protests, the most recent of which killed a street vendor who was just an innocent bystander. The interesting thing is that no one&nbsp;</span><em>knows</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;who's staging these attacks. Some believe it's the government; some believe it's coming from the protesters themselves in an attempt to garner more public sympathy, and there are other theories as well. In any case, these attacks are suspected to increase as the election approaches.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In addition, Taksin has been trying to convince some of his supporters that the king, genuinely liked by people in general, is a bad guy. Taksin supporters have been wearing red [\"Because they don't like the king--except 'everyone likes the king', because that's the law...\"], whereas supporters of the king have been wearing yellow [the color of the monarchy].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Wait, but I thought it was illegal to say anything against the king.\" Even stepping on or damaging Thai currency [all of which bears a portrait of the king] is considered extremely offensive and can result in jail time.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"It is, but Taksin's rich and powerful enough to get away with it. The crappy thing is that in general the protesters are good people, but their leader is awful. He's just as corrupt; he's buying votes too. A lot of the protesters know this, but they're still for the greater cause and are just glad that there&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;a leader.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"How do I find out more about this? Can I read about it?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Well...the American media is all pro-Taksin, so they paint a one-sided picture; anything you've seen on CNN is pretty biased. On the other hand, the media in Bangkok, both Thai and English, is all written by the protesters, the educated and wealthier urban Thais, so it's also biased. The people here who are against the protests have a good case as well, but they generally aren't communicating through writing--they'll do heated radio broadcasts, in Thai of course.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Our conversation went on to a discussion of tourism in Thailand, and what Alex and I were hoping to do next.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"A lot of people think tourism's been destroying Thailand, and that it won't be a viable tourist destination for much longer. We're falling really far behind in terms of public transit--Vietnam's ahead of us, and Malaysia's way ahead. Our transit really just takes tourists in mind, rather than locals. Burma's behind--but the US is investing a ton of money in Burma.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Why?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Alex chipped in merrily, \"More poor people to exploit.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Terrance added, \"Well, think about it. The US put a bunch of factories in China. China's been growing in power, and so they've been moving the factories to Vietnam. Now Vietnam's coming up, and so&nbsp;</span><em>they're</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;going to stick the factories in Burma.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Ew. But that makes sense.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Well, a lot of things make sense&nbsp;</span><em>monetarily</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">, at least.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"It seems like a lot of the islands are being overtaken as well. People have been recommending islands for us to go visit, and they'll say things like, 'This island is like what Ko Samui used to be before it got overrun by tourist resorts and got all crowded and polluted--go visit it now, while it's still pristine, because it won't last.' There's this transference of the 'remote island experience' as each one gets over-developed in turn, like they're all catching some contagious disease.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Alex said, \"I really want to head down south and see some of the islands, though I guess they're pretty touristy.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Alex.&nbsp;</span><em>We're</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;tourists, too. Even if we try and pretend we're not--you've said that yourself.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"I know, but there are different kinds of tourists.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Terrance said, \"Well, think of it this way. You can go down south to&nbsp;</span><em>look</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;at all the tourists, like going to the zoo; or you can go north and&nbsp;</span><em>be</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;a tourist. The sort of tourists you'll meet up north are probably all going to be backpackers.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Alex laughed, \"Like the zoo...sort of 'meta-tourism'.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I asked him about the Full Moon Parties on Ko Pha Ngan, which we'd been hearing a lot of mention of. \"They sound like beach raves. And they happen every month?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Yeah, pretty much. DJs and drugs. And they happen virtually every night, now--there are Half Moon Parties, Quarter Moon Parties, Three Quarter Moon Parties...\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"So what were they, originally?\" I'd assumed there was some rich cultural background behind them, and that their current incarnation was just the result of them being modernized.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Uh, no...they're basically just big parties where tourists can go do drugs without worrying as much about getting in trouble as they would elsewhere in the country.\" In Thailand, drug punishments are severe--in general, for many Southeast Asian countries the penalty for possession of certain quantities is mandatory execution, and even being found with drugs in your system [even if you can prove you consumed the drugs outside the country's borders] can land you in jail for a long, long time.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">He added, \"It's not really my thing. And it's not so much the party atmosphere that alienates me--it's that everyone there seems completely disinterested in the place they're in. There are parts of Bangkok where a lot of the people are just there to get wasted, but it has nothing to do with&nbsp;</span><em>being in Thailand.</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;They're doing the same stuff they'd be doing in Vegas. There's just a disconnect.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"I hear you. All that being said...we're probably going to go check it out.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Well, of course. If only to say you did it. It's just one of those things.\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>The Tourist Drag&nbsp;</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Alex and I have been having a lot of conversations we weren't expecting to have--about what it means to be a tourist, and whether we can really differentiate ourselves from the caricatures of \"dumb, entitled, fat Western invaders,\" or not. Perhaps we couldn't, despite efforts to be conscientious, to support small businesses, to respect cultural norms, to learn the language.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">On New Years Eve in a Capitola beach house, our friend Hana had told us [and I'm paraphrasing pretty hard because I was extremely intoxicated at the time], \"When I went to Southeast Asia the hardest thing to come to terms with was that I was really just another one of the millions of white backpackers--and there was no way to really separate from them. A lot of them were all trying to separate and count themselves as different, but we were all there as visitors, we weren't really ever going to assimilate to the culture, we were there on different pretenses to begin with--because we're privileged first-worlders who can afford to go travel for fun with our nice backpacks that the locals could never afford.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Those words have been on my mind quite a bit, and I keep going back and forth with what's possible, what we should and shouldn't care about. Is it just delusional to think we need to differentiate ourselves from the other tourists who are propagating cultural degeneration? Is it inevitable that we're contributing to it, too? Or do we have a responsibility, as tourists, to be conscientious of things other tourists ignore? Is&nbsp;there any way to tap in and&nbsp;</span><em>really</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;be participants, rather than spectators? Or is it self-righteous and ignorant to even try?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In any case, for the next two days we decided to bite the bullet and embrace our tourist-ness.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We went with Jones to Ko San Road [which we'd originally been keen to avoid because we figured it'd be \"full of tourists\"], to meet up with some of his native Thai friends. It was a lot of fun--it actually reminded me a lot of the French Quarter in New Orleans [particularly Bourbon Street].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We started off with a bucket of rum and coke that had three straws in it so we could suck it down family-style [though I was pretty sure there was not really any rum in it]. A guy was playing the guitar and singing covers [Jack Johnson, the Eagles, standard American fare] who was fantastic; at first we thought he was lip-syncing until we were able to pick out his accent. Vendors came by our table, pointing lasers at us, playing wooden frogs, trying silently to entice us into buying trinkets. Eventually we caved when a lady bearing scorpions came by. None of us were genuinely interested in scorpions ourselves so much as we were trying to convince each other to eat them. Of course, being a bit tipsy already, this led to us each buying one. Pretty sure that's how it always happens.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">They weren't as gross as I thought they'd be. Kind of like crunchy dirt. Later when we met up with Ning and Toffee, both of whom grew up in Thailand, they informed me that the silkworms were better [I tried some, and they were--sort of like french fries].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We all got a tower of Chang beer--holy shit those things are&nbsp;</span><em>huge</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">, and so cheap--the girls laughed at how surprised I was; I suppose that's a standard newcomer reaction. Nearby, a troupe of seven-year old boys were breakdancing before an enthusiastic cell-phone-camera-equipped crowd [\"I can't even tell if those kids are good or not, but they sure have enthusiasm\"].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Ning mentioned she'd be heading to Chiang Mai on Sunday--Alex and I had been trying to work out the logistics of how best to get there--and offered to pick up tickets for us so we could all go. Perfect.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Afterwards we headed to a wine bar in Nana [the area Alex and I had spent our first couple nights in--decidedly way more obnoxious than Ko San], and I bought an elderflower cocktail that cost more than I'd spent on food in the last two days. We wandered around the ritzy street, past several bar vans, and witnessed two six-year-old girls running by and stealing an absent-minded&nbsp;</span><em>farang</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">'s drinks he'd left on a table, chugging them as they sprinted away. The guy, clearly a scrooge, did not find this hilarious. On a whim, we waited in line to get into a fancy night club that presumably didn't have a cover, in a long line of people who looked like they'd been plucked straight out of L.A., and the guy at the door berated Alex for his cut-off pants and wouldn't let us in [\"Sir, we have a strict dress code here...no shorts, especially not shorts that are&nbsp;</span><em>torn</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;like&nbsp;</span><em>rags!\"<span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;</span></em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">and so on].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The next day we headed to JJ [Chatuchak weekend market] with Jones and April, an awesome Chinese girl who'd settled on Bangkok after extensive traveling and was working as a freelance Mandarin teacher. [Back at Terrance's place, we met another Chinese girl with near-perfect English named Papaya who had traveled extensively and worked as a translator.] I'd wandered away from the group to find ice cream while they were waiting on some paella from a large dancing chef, and had gotten completely lost on my way back to find them. The place is huge and completely disorienting--I don't think any description would do it justice. Permanent shopfronts like stores at the mall, but sliced in half, opened onto dense hallways bursting with goods for sale like at the Platinum Fashion Mall, only this place had everything. We walked through aisles of puppies [\"They're so cute, it hurts...but this all seems kind of suspicious; they're&nbsp;</span><em>only</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;selling puppies...what happens when no one buys them?\"] and then wound up in what we called the \"incense section\", and continues roaming for a few hours. I bought a tiny sewing machine [that I'd originally mistaken for a small stapler] for 60 baht [under $2].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Afterwards, we headed to the nearby park and took turns playing Jones' guitar by the pond. A little later, the national anthem came on [which I hadn't witnessed yet]. Everyone in the park stood up and froze. We followed suit, and I tried not to laugh as I looked across the pond at a hundred statues. Ah, nationalism.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418297156425-VVYO5NPY4BDPA4JVYC1W/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Last night, Terrance sent us out to a tucked-away local restaurant that we never would've found on our own--he'd told us in advance what to order [and had written down the names in Thai so that there'd be no confusion]. It was incredible, and the first legitimately spicy meal we've had here [we've since been told that Bangkok food really isn't all that spicy and that we'll have to head north to get our asses blasted off].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">So, today is our last day in Bangkok. Heading to Chiang Mai on the 10p.m. bus. A photographer from Israel was going to hire me for a shoot in Bangkok if we could stay another week or so--but even though this place has caught us under its spell and there's definitely much more we could see and do here, we just want to move on. We've gotten comfortable here and would rather get out prematurely, and look forward to coming back in the future, than overstay our enthusiasm.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Besides, it's hard to practice our Thai in a place where most everyone understands some English.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1418297432513-3J8R96WWVT3UTJ69E4G9/7.jpg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1418296427591_84348\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Random Closing Thoughts</strong></span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Newest addiction: chrysanthemum drinks. Holy shit.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Way too much plastic everywhere. If we buy a bottle of water from 7-eleven [which we often have to do since the tap water isn't potable], they try and send us away with a bag and a straw.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The only people I've seen wearing stereotypical \"Thai clothes\"--the long flowing skirts and genie pants and embroidered sandals--are foreign white tourists [myself included]. Everyone who lives in Bangkok, on the other hand, dresses in the same jeans and button-downs and sweaters you'd see in New York or wherever else. Ha. I suppose this might change once I get out of the city?</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Beer on ice really isn't bad, as blasphemous as that may sound.</span><br><br><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Stray dogs here seem a lot smarter than American dogs. They look both ways before crossing the street and compose themselves with a quiet vigilance, never chasing after shit or barking. I always thought dogs were kind of dopey and stupid [in the best way], but maybe they're just coddled into incompetency, like people can be. Nature vs. nurture.</span><br><br><span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Oh, fun fact: Bangkok has the longest name of any city [for those who didn't know]. It more-or-less translates to: \"The city of angels, the great city, the residence of the Emerald Buddha, the impregnable city [unlike Ayutthaya] of God Indra, the grand capital of the world endowed with nine precious gems, the happy city, abounding in an enormous Royal Palace that resembles the heavenly abode where reigns the reincarnated god, a city given by Indra and built by Vishnukarn\". Also, Bangkok is only \"Bangkok\" to English-speakers. The Thai name for it sounds more like </span><em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">runt t</span></em><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><em>ep.</em>&nbsp;So. Now you know. [And knowing is half the battle?]</span></span></p>\n</div>",

Upon returning to Terrance's on Sunday evening [after getting some phenomenal&nbsp;</span><em>som tam,</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;or green papaya salad] he informed us that the protest leader had just been shot dead.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We spent that night on a sleeper bus along with Jones and April, during which we all attempted to study the Thai alphabet using children's books with minimal success, and all woke up about an hour before our 7:20 a.m. arrival because they'd cranked the air conditioning down to nothing-degrees. When we arrived, we shared a&nbsp;</span><em>songtaew&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">[that is, a pick-up truck with two benches and a roof in the back serving as a taxi] with some Canadians to get to the Old City [since we'd failed to watch what the locals had done in order to leave the station, which probably would've revealed a cheaper way of getting into town].</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957514936-LYL78NTNPD7JNJRZC3LN/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957536310-KBM2RUD4G8NGIL6A6BD7/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Closing thoughts on Bangkok: New York City is an obese, narcoleptic geriatric&nbsp;in comparison [whereas Bangkok is some scruffy-but-vaguely-glamorous young thing you might run into on some altered night in a dive bar outside your normal neck of the woods, charismatic but possibly a bit misleading, maybe subtly hopped up on some varietal of white powder, beckoning you congenially to follow him down to his subtropolis].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Summarily, Bangkok lived up to its stereotypes. For locals and tourists alike, it seemed like the two main things to do during the day were eat and shop [but it was easy to see why].&nbsp;At night, the eating and shopping continues behind the nocturnal backdrop of colorful bars, strobes and lasers, lanky hookers, cheap massage parlors [which, by the way,&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;offer--and sometimes insist upon--the delivery of happy endings] and the penetrating thrum of</span><em>&nbsp;nnts-nnts-nnts</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I loved it, but it was making me feel sluggish and stupid all the time, like my brain was tapped out on the constant stimulation. Everything was so new, even the daily walks to the BTS--past little boys dangling fishing poles over a city bridge overhung with barbaric trees that remind us we'd be in a jungle if not for urbanization, past lightning-fast fry cooks chugging down a bottle of Chang in between serving ten people a minute, past a horde of ladyboys foraging through a two-mile succession of clothing vendors--felt dense and fast and bright. Of course, it was partly culture shock--those sights have now become mundanities--but Bangkok still gets some credit for being altogether more alive than the cities I've been used to.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Chiang Mai, on the other hand, makes me feel almost too relaxed and on top of things. For better or for worse, it's almost too easy: our private room is $7 total per night; if we want to get out of town, we can rent a fast scooter right downstairs for $6; within twenty feet of the guest house are a million food carts at all hours of the day, each cheaper and better than the last; every conceivable brand of nightlife is reachable within a three-minute walk; and, with the moat around the Old City, it's virtually impossible to get lost.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957666694-AZTV0HI7BDLT8LVM6DFT/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">On the one hand, the place has sucked us into wanting to just kick back and live here for a while [which seems to happen to a lot of people here]; on the other, it feels too comfortable and I feel like I'm cheating, like I need to pursue a more rugged destination. Despite the complete dissimilarity between here and anywhere I've thought of as \"home\", being here makes me feel like a homebody.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Tucked in among Thai culture and hundreds of majestic&nbsp;</span><em>wats</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;[Alex: \"It's almost disappointing just how&nbsp;</span><em>many</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;temples there are. They're gorgeous, but they're just fucking everywhere; after a day you're desensitized and basically see them as road blocks.\"] is a sort of Hippie Disneyland Village of Hostels, which I suppose can be seen as bad or good--as a cultural parasite or a natural progression of the city's adaptation to global tourism. At any rate, Chiang Mai is a gallery for every stereotype of expat and tourist: granola festie-kid types, Golden Anniversary re-honeymooners, douchebaggy European spring breakers, and so on. Homemade flyers in all the restaurants of a guy who'll give you dreadlocks, or a woman who does Tarot readings. Ex-pat cafes serving ayurvedic teas with coconut milk and stevia. And so on.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957719234-ZYHCHBOV8PZC9FXY1OH8/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Quick answers to my previous two questions:</p><p>Mosquito-wise, it seems the locals mainly rely on diet [lemongrass and garlic, particularly]. Sometimes people even bring a bit of lemongrass around with them, in their pocket or some such. Other than that, mosquito coils and fans. Not much else. [Still went ahead and got a bottle of citronella spray, since I've been shoving garlic into my face and am not sure it's actually working.]<br /><br />Temple-wise, it's kind of a no-brainer now that I know. Thai people [and people who can pass for Thai] get in free, and don't really go to the big swanky temples to worship [they've got their own temples for that--the same way Catholics don't necessarily go hang out in Notre Dame every Sunday]. Well, hurp dap.<br /><br />Fun fact: We've been enjoying Thailand's longest cold season in ten years [they usually last a couple weeks; this one's lasted for months]. The other morning the cold was \"record-breaking\", at a frigid 15° C [that's about 60° F]. To me, this seems like great weather, but there have already been at least sixty-three Thai deaths related to the cold, and when we've gone out at times when there's been a mid-80-ish going, several people are walking around in sweaters, winter jackets, and long underwear.<br /><br />...Yeah, so. We've yet to find out what they consider \"hot\" to be.</p><p><strong>Bua Tong Waterfall</strong><br /><br />Easily one of the coolest places I've ever been. I've never been much for a good \"view\" or for \"scenery\"--I like to interact with things. I like mountains I can climb up or ski down or camp underneath, and lakes I can swim in. If all I want to do is look at a place, I can pick up a postcard.<br /><br />This waterfall? There's a wonky set of steps alongside of it that'll take you to the bottom where, thanks to calcium carbonate deposits on the face, you can walk back up it&nbsp;<em>on the face</em>, like a steep bulbous staircase. It's also known as the \"sticky waterfall\". There's not a whole lot I can say that pictures won't say better.<br /><br />Starting from the bottom, working up:&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957757777-44Q5SIU8KN6GFXFN3M24/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957892798-5UFFJ5LIMVOH9YUNDFPG/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957922644-S8X75RF04TBSDBOPI5ZI/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958038129-5P63FCS4YHKEWCODNJO6/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958078629-Q4Z0IIU8KFW5NMMM8JRP/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958108685-11TU1QQKTTIRYG468UW5/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957999533-TT0A7L4Y8Q1Q1ZLDR54U/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417957849080-5EXWBZTE6OPISFHXDC50/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958185773-AIUEICMXMVCD429TZ4Y6/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Getting to it involved renting scooters and driving more than an hour into the countryside past rice paddies, clusters of banana trees, and temples. We stopped on the way for some fermented pork rice and deep-fried sweet potatoes--and a local vendor let me sample some crickets, which were actually quite good.<br /><br />On the way back, we drove past the site of an accident--all that was left was a smashed scooter and puddle of blood--which had us feeling a bit apprehensive about navigating the rush hour traffic. Consequently, we lost Jones and April on their scooter, and we'd been following them to get home since they had the directions. Our phone was dead, and our map was in English, which wasn't helpful.<br /><br />After the initial frustration of being lost, I was overtaken in a new sense of freedom. So far, it's almost felt like this trip has been too easy--exhausting, perhaps, but posing no true challenges.<br /><br />Granted, I'm not saying this was really a challenge, either--we were basically already in town and found our way back after about five minutes of gesturing on a map to some Thais in a shop--but it gave me a chance to reflect on what's always appealed to me about traveling in the States. The sense of uncertainty and risk. For some reason, I've been a lot more wary here, always thinking of tomorrow [in terms of money, what we'll do, visa logistics, possible issues...] and while I haven't been overanxious, the whole&nbsp;<em>point</em>&nbsp;of my travels in the states has been to free myself of any place and time other than the here and now, and traveling abroad shouldn't be fundamentally different.<br /><br /><strong>The Anti-Monk</strong><br /><br />That first night, while navigating through the bazaar stalls, I almost ran headlong into a monk [fortunately, I didn't--monks aren't supposed to touch women; if they do, they have to go through arduous cleansing rituals], who gestured for me to move aside, then approached Alex and put a string of beads around his neck. He started rubbing Alex's chest and whispering things that we couldn't understand, and made Alex kiss the necklace. Then he asked Alex for 100&nbsp;<em>baht</em>&nbsp;and, when Alex shook his head, chuckling, took the necklace back and walked away.<br /><br />\"I...don't think that guy was a real monk. That, or he's a rebellious one. A lot of the monks get offended if you even try to give them money--why would one be going around asking for it?\"<br /><br />\"I bet it was a test--maybe he was whispering something like, 'I'm going to try to take the necklace off of you. If you don't let me do it, you'll win Enlightenment.'\"<br /><br />Since that night, we've run into him at least once per night, always only going after young white men [he's tried to get Alex again at least two or three times and walks off with a bitter smile and what sound like Thai pejoratives each time we start laughing].<br /><br />I might be developing a bit of an obsession with him. We'll see him in two different spots in one night, miles apart. The other night, he was sitting on a bench outside of our guesthouse. I would've struck up a conversation with him but he seems to speak no English [and my Thai isn't good enough to transcend basic niceties]. He's<em>everywhere we are.</em><br /><br />So.<br /><br />One: Who the hell is this guy? Is he a real monk?<br /><br /><strong>Nocturnal Everything</strong><br /><br />I think this place has the right idea. Chiang Mai isn't exactly metropolitan, and yet it comes alive at night. There are a million food carts, most of the restaurants in town stay open until at least midnight [as do many other shops, including bookstores and cafes], huge marketplaces and night-only shopping centers, random shows [many of them free], and an absurd row of backpacker bars that felt like Bourbon Street at Mardi Gras when we went on a Monday night.<br /><br />On our first night, we headed out to the night bazaar with Jones [April had passed out], all hankering for a beer. Dirtbags that we are, we opted to go buy beer at the corner store and then bring it into a food court with our dinner [right next to some Khmer dancers--easily the most benign form of dance I've ever seen, like stylized somnambulism...except for the crazy-triple-jointed-backward-flexed fingers, which is the one interesting thing about the dance style, and which hurt my joints to look at].<br /><br />Along with the standard Chang [which I've actually gotten pretty fond of...I've heard it referred to as \"Asian PBR\" or similar, but I think it's actually a fuckload better than your standard cheap beer] we grabbed a bottle of some mystery booze because it was 30&nbsp;<em>baht</em>&nbsp;for a large.<br /><br />Mistake. It tasted like fish oil with grape juice. We all decided we had to choke it down to get our money's worth, and after a couple attempts&nbsp;<em>each&nbsp;</em>deserted the thing, still more than half-full.<br /><br />We found April drinking by a closed leather workshop with two friendly and inebriated Thai men with a guitar, both of whom were named Egg [though one of them also answered to \"Johnny Depp\"] and a rad Australian girl named Ella, who introduced herself to us in a weird Asian-y-Pidgin-esque pseudo-accent before adjusting: \"Oh, sorry--I've been hanging out with Thais so much it's got me speaking in broken English to compensate.\"<br /><br />After some general merrymaking all of us left Egg and Egg to go check out the backpacker bars, a condensed block about a hundred feet long, to meet up with Ning. I can best describe it as a really compressed Bourbon Street with a dash of Burning Man. A Thai band was covering Pantera in one bar that was next door to a reggae bar that was next door to some place playing hard rock; in the middle of the row were two nightclubs complete with lasers and fog machines blaring dubstep at one another as if in a face-off; the places were so bloated with shitfaced Commonwealthers that they spilled out into the street, which served as an extension of the conjoined dance party.&nbsp;<br /><br />\"Isn't it a Monday night?\"<br /><br />We all decided to make the most of our situation by mini flash-mobbing unsuspecting clubbers on the dance floor, and took turns selecting victims. One by one, we'd squeeze our way through the mash of people and circle around our victim--and then spontaneously start jumping/dancing/fist-pumping insanely when we had him completely surrounded.<br /><br />First guy, who was clearly blacked out, was stoked, and started whooping at us in what sounded like gibberish and laughing. Second guy&nbsp;<em>freaked</em>&nbsp;the fuck out and had bolted straight out of the club within three seconds.<br /><br />And so on.<br /><br />We saw the maybe-monk there, too, provocatively rubbing the nipples of some bro in another loud nightclub, while a six-year old Thai boy leaned stood and watched while leaning against the bar. Not something you see every day. Jones decided he had to go \"get a blessing\" for himself, and came back reporting that it was an unprecedentedly erotic experience, what with all the nipple-rubbing and mumbling.</p><p>And so on.<br /><br />April and Jones headed out a day or so later, which reminded me of one of my favorite aspects of traveling--sort of sloughing together a temporary \"crew\" of people you've just met, hanging out more-or-less as you would with your close friends from back home, for a couple days or a couple weeks, and then parting ways just as simply. About five minutes after we said goodbye to the two of them, we met up with Alberto, a guy we'd spent a single night talking to back at the hostel in Reno. A couple days later, we met a guy named Nathan for the first time after a mutual friend insisted upon it via Facebook; we wound up talking ceaselessly for several hours [one thing that stood out to me was our mutual observations of the incompatibilities between Buddhism and Buddhist culture--similar to Christianity and Christian culture--and grappling with consequent disillusionment].<br /><br />There's something elegant and genuine about it, as opposed to socializing back home--when you're a fixture somewhere, it gets easy to fall into a rut of hanging out with the same people all the time, regardless of whether you actually want to [and, in the cases of shared mutual friends, regardless of whether you even&nbsp;<em>like</em>&nbsp;everyone you're hanging out with], because they're available.<br /><br /><strong>And so on</strong><br /><br />It's been pretty mellow. We've spent a lot of time teaching ourselves to read and write in Thai in a decidedly New Agey tea house in an upstairs loft overlooking the bustling-but-cozy&nbsp;<em>soi</em>&nbsp;we've affectionately come to think of as our \"neighborhood\", drinking fancy Ayurvedic teas and lemongrass kombucha while flopped over Thai massage mats and pillows. In one corner are hula hoops and guitars to tinker on, in another are random goods for sale [diva cups, natural face creams, flower of life stickers]. The place is run by an Austrian ex-pat hippie girl and hosts yoga classes, movie nights, open mic nights. While I initially came here with what I now think was a bit of a naive purist attitude of what is/isn't \"real\" Thai culture...I've begun to realize that all of this stuff&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;a part of contemporary Chiang Mai culture--it's a melting pot, and the natives seem to have embraced this.<br /><br />Lots of wandering around, sitting in parks, trying new food. Eating has been our primary pastime, I'd say. Figuring out our favorites--like Thai iced tea served in a giant plastic bag stabbed with a straw [the packaging here is pretty insane--you have to be pretty assertive if you don't want every small purchase you make to get stuck into five different plastic bags].<br /><br />Speaking of eating, I forced myself to try durian no fewer than three times, and hereby declare that it resembles soggy garbage in both taste and texture.<br /><br />The&nbsp;<strong>Ladyboy Cabaret</strong>, a free nightly show we came across unintentionally while hanging out with Alberto. We sat down in front of two unfinished Heinekens, which we helped ourselves to [Alberto: \"Is it really beer, or is it piss?\" Us: \"It's piss.\"] I quite enjoyed the guys' noticeable ambivalence as we watched what appeared to be several scantily-clad and legitimately gorgeous women waggling flamboyantly on stage. A couple acts involved a hot \"woman\" transforming [via costume changes and make-up remover and wigs] into a handsome dude. Pretty killer, especially for the price tag.<br /><br />As I suspected, massage up north is far superior to everything I found in Bangkok. In particular, I really wanted to go get a&nbsp;<strong>Nerve Touch</strong>&nbsp;massage, a specialized style of Thai massage that I've trained in. Easily one of the most effective massages I've ever gotten. It's been days since then, and we both feel fucking phenomenal. Without realizing it, Alex had gotten a massage from the current Nerve Touch instructor [the one before her was the founder of the style, who taught my own instructor in Nevada City]...and when we got to the register they informed us that the price for his massage was 950&nbsp;<em>baht.</em>&nbsp;Luckily for us, they were really gracious when they saw how shocked we were and honored the normal price, realizing that we hadn't known. [Though, to put it in perspective, that'd&nbsp;<em>still</em>&nbsp;be a fucking steal by American standards, especially for how good of a massage it was: less than $30 for an hour and a half].<br /><br />We also spent a day at&nbsp;<strong>Huay Tung Tao</strong>, a lake about twenty minutes outside of town, eating lunch [and subsequently falling asleep] atop&nbsp;a bamboo hut over the water. It wound up being pricier than we'd expected after the scooter rental, entrance fees, and pricey food, but was worth it. That being said, there's so much amazing free stuff to do in the area that I don't see myself going back.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958318560-4TCMF2T46O080V2TLTTB/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958285424-B4EMU5DUR9VH0W2U6QA1/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958355594-FACI8GTGVTG42O51HNLU/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>We've spent two days looking for Saimok Kap Dokmai, an edible flower restaurant that's supposedly ten minutes out of town, but fucking&nbsp;<em>impossible</em>&nbsp;to find. The other night we gave up after almost three hours of circling around on a scooter, backtracking and asking for directions a million times. At one point we'd turned down a deserted road and saw a bunch of people walking towards something...so we followed, thinking it might take us to a night market or some other event where we could re-orient ourselves.<br /><br />We were at a temple. There were eerie lights [candles, glowsticks, and lasers] and some intensely somber chanting. People were sitting in silence, and we couldn't see what they were all staring at. Blood sugar critically low, it took us a second of whispering to each other in the back to realize we weren't at a market or other public event.<br /><br />\"Whoa, is this some sort of occult ritual?\"<br /><br />\"Uh. Anna. I don't think we should be here...\"<br /><br />It was then that we saw what appeared to be a casket, or at least a shrine decked out with some guy's picture. Whoops.<br /><br />Two: Find this damn flower restaurant. It looks fucking awesome [flower salads, flower drinks, fried flowers...]. Even if it means renting a tuk-tuk. Or a guide. I'm too proud to let it go after we've invested so much time into it. 8P<br /><br />Three: Most of the beggars we've seen have been amputees. I want to know why that is. My imagination's gone nuts. Are they being exploited by a con artist who's cutting off their tongues and limbs? Are they all victims of workplace injuries [wouldn't be too surprising--we've had to tiptoe around people welding in the sidewalk without so much as a pair of safety goggles or long pants]? Is there some leprosy-esque outbreak affecting the local poor?<br /><br />And so on.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417958493946-LDA4RFPS5KBRYCE7BO00/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1417928307253_670804\"><br></p>\n</div>",

Inevitably, we'll realize [sometimes not until after we've exchanged information and committed to spending a day together] that we have&nbsp;</span><em>nothing</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;in common and find each other's worldviews completely alienating.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It's so easygoing that&nbsp;</span><em>not</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;becoming a bit listless requires an active effort. I feel like Alex and I are Baloo and Mowgli, lumbering around the jungle eating ants and fruits at our leisure. Consequently, I'm beginning to bore myself.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Where to next? Deciding between Chiang Rai and Nong Khai [leaning heavily towards the former].</span><br /><br /><strong>Tourist Binge</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We decided to spend twenty-four hours doing standard \"touristy\" things, which we'd been avoiding. In general, I think tours are a way to preclude living: to be a spectator rather than a participant, and to possibly learn about other things in a very packaged way while making sure you don't learn&nbsp;</span><em>anything</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;about yourself. Tours are a way to focus more on taking canned photos that say \"look how much fun I'm having\" than on actually having fun.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">However...when else am I going to get to hug a tiger?</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417932445426-B84BCF72FGM04G5Y5HZB/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417932015907-RI0EP739UN59IKC9VMVF/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">After reading about several unethical animal tourist attractions in Thailand where animals are abused or drugged into sedation, we were wary of Tiger Kingdom and initially set on avoiding it. However, after scrounging around a bit online for information, and talking to a few people who'd gone, we decided to give it a shot. At least as far as we could see, the tigers didn't show signs of being drugged and seemed pretty healthy, and seemed to have pretty trust-based bonds with their caretakers. Additionally, which tigers were open to be pet by tourists seemed to rotate around, so that individual tigers would get breaks and days off; they seemed better off&nbsp;than many&nbsp;zoo animals, at least. For whatever that's worth.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14.40000057220459px\">Well, no regrets,&nbsp;we did it. Still not sure how I feel about it.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">As Alex put it, \"Well...they're definitely being patronized, which is kind of embarrassing to look at, but they seem pretty content and healthy.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I mean, we're guilty of patronizing them, too, as the photos above indicate [with the tiger trainers instructing us on how to pose, \"Do mustache tail!\"]...granted, the tigers didn't seem to give much of a shit, except for one adult female who either wanted to play with, or eat, Alex.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It was awesome but we left with a bit of awkward ambivalence.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The Siam Insect Zoo, on the other hand, was far less ideologically complicated [and also cheaper].&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417932255736-L4S9CSDAWAG0VIIISHCP/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417932516407-371O4ZA8K7DC5R1YAP2Y/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Then we went on a tour of handicraft factories. This basically consisted of being picked up by a quirky guy who'd drive us somewhere, then hang out while we poked around and asked questions [and, of course, were coaxed into gift shops]. The factory workers would go about their business, seemingly indifferent to our presence.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The cost for a group is 300&nbsp;</span><em>baht.</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;So, $10 for the two of us to have a private driver for the morning take us to eight factories and an awesome and decently-priced lunch spot.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">First stop: paper umbrella factory. A couple guys near the entrance asked to paint waterproof designs on our t-shirts for 50&nbsp;</span><em>baht,&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">so we let them.

Little knives and so on. Nothing is mechanized. The umbrellas ranged in size from a few inches to over six feet in diameter.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Next we visited a jewelry factory, which was far more intimidating--a huge building flanked by really uptight-looking and smartly-uniformed employees, following us watchfully. We weren't allowed to take photos, which is a shame, as the factory and showroom were pretty impressive.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Third was a lacquerware factory, with all sorts of charming wooden doodads, all intricately hand-painted.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417932890094-CJFBAE6YMD5EC3IPN9ED/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417932917848-ETH5M94LK20G10NSD8DU/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417932970932-SCJ9FS3DAFGXKM2XTRCT/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Fourth was a silk factory, and possibly my favorite. The silkworms are raised until they form cocoons, which are then boiled and spun to extract the silk--it takes 50 cocoons to make one thread, and each cocoon yields about 500-800 meters of silk. They're then washed and tinted with natural dyes before they get strung up on the looms. One of the women there showed us how to spot real silk from imitation silk [which is all over the night markets].</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417933097587-YK07CEVTDGYKWH8EFBGN/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417933147759-YWPQAQF5NLZ2R2AGIJK7/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417933273420-SG5GZ0HGM6A6BCWZDAM8/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Fifth,&nbsp;a&nbsp;jade factory.

A smooth-talking Indian salesman handed me a carved wooden box and told me he'd give us 1000&nbsp;</span><em>baht</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;if I could open it [since it was a puzzle with a secret lock, which he didn't tell us] and I figured it out in about ten seconds, which left him pretty embarrassed [but not enough to stop trying to sell us expensive scarves].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The final stop sold leather goods, though the \"factory\" itself seemed to only focus on stitching the already-processed leather into items. I would've liked to see them actually making leather, but we were burnt out by then anyhow.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">So, our mission complete, we put the camera away and resumed being regular&nbsp;humans.</span><br /><br /><strong>Re: The Anti-Monk</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I have become somewhat obsessed. This guy is everywhere.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We've spotted him again several times, a couple of them right by our guest house, which is on a rather nondescript little&nbsp;</span><em>soi</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;and not much of a destination unless you're staying there.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We spotted him at one of the vendor booths run by a couple of little ladies selling typical tourist trinkets [noise-making wooden frogs, wristbands bearing such tasteful&nbsp;phrases as <em>up butt no baby</em>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">and <em>i heart rape</em>]</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">, counting out cash. I was somewhat inebriated and, excitedly&nbsp;ran across the street and tried to get a photo, but was so nervous and&nbsp;ambivalent the whole time [\"Man, it is&nbsp;</span><em>really</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;creepy and maybe a bit dehumanizing for me to be doing this right now...mm, they're all blurry...oh-shit-I-think-he-saw-me...\"] that I dilly-dallied and not only failed to take a decent photo before running away guiltily [the grainy, unfocused piece of shit below is the best one I got] but seeing him there under the light, which gave his face a rather eerie glow [he's got an eerily calm look about him, anyway--like a Guy Fawkes mask, sort of serene and smiling and sociopathic--which is largely why I wanted a photo of him] made him look like some sort of mobster-of-the-underworld, and I started making up all manner of possible scenarios about what he could be doing with the ladies at the booth.&nbsp;</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417934177624-FVUI18C8GTWNC0RR98SV/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The next morning, I was glad no recognizable&nbsp;photos came out—both in respect for the guy's privacy [really was kind of a dick move on my part but, hey, I got excited...and was possibly quite a bit drunk] and because my memory will embellish the image and make it seem more dramatic and exciting over time, whereas a photo would keep my memory in check and prevent me from over-romanticizing.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Sometimes it's best to toss out the empiricism in the name of deluded aesthetics.</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Also, I've realized that I probably&nbsp;</span><em>don't</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;want to solve the mystery. He's probably just a scammer/street performer in a robe...but not having this&nbsp;</span><em>confirmed</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;as a fact allows my imagination to get the better of me, which is much more fun. Sometimes knowledge isn't everything.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><strong>Disillusionment</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Before heading on this trip, we'd read several warnings [on sites like Wikitravel that are supposed to serve as guides] about Thai people--to look out for scams, or possible threats.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Since we've been here, the only unpleasantness we've seen is from other tourists [and holy&nbsp;</span><em>shit</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;can they be nasty, especially to the Thai natives...probably because they've read all the same Doomsday propaganda about how Thais are all trying to fuck them over].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The other day, we went out on a scooter to find that flower restaurant again. We wound up in a strange back alley by a corner store that was closing up, so I went in and asked the old couple in charge if they knew where the place was. They didn't speak English, but the tiny little Thai man gave a huge smile and gestured for us to follow him--then ran out, hopped on his scooter, and led us there. It was a good mile or so out of the way, too.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">When we got there, it was closed, even though we'd shown up at their business hours. The man gestured for us to follow him again, and took us through a shortcut to get back on the road for the Old City, waving at us from his motorbike when he figured he'd taken us far enough and turning around to go home and we continued on, grinning.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"You know...even though the place was closed, I've got this sense of closure. I think it just made my day how nice that man was.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"...Meh, the place was a bit pricey, anyway. Almost three bucks a dish!\"</span></p><p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Man, we're spoiled.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">As another example, the lady who runs our guest house. She works seven days a week managing three guesthouses and a restaurant, and renting out scooters. Her English is good and we've also heard her speak to guests in French and Mandarin. When our scooter got a flat the other day and stranded us outside of town [a misadventure I'll get to in a second], she told us not to worry about getting it fixed or paying for it even though it was technically our bad, she's not a stickler if we pay after check-out time, and she's changed our sheets even though we told her not to worry about it.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Every day, we see several douche bags—usually young and trendy Americans, Australians, or Europeans—come up with an absolutely disgusting level of entitlement.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"I'm sorry, all the rooms are full today except our luxury suite on the top floor--it's 700&nbsp;</span><em>baht.&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">You can look around and come back if you can't find another room--I'll be here for a few more hours. If you need a place to stay just for the night, you can always find a cheaper place tomorrow, since it's getting late.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"...And I have to go up fucking&nbsp;</span><em>stairs&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">to waste my money? Uh, yeah, no thanks, you've wasted&nbsp;</span><em>enough</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;of my time.\" And off huffed yet another pretty and wealthy-looking brat with a backpack. Incidentally, 700&nbsp;</span><em>baht</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;is still just over $20.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Sure, a lot of locals will quote you higher prices, but worst case scenario just means you get duped into paying more than you might've gotten away with had you known better; the&nbsp;</span><em>only reason they succeed</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;is because even the \"rip-off\" marked-up price sounds cheap to westerners. If you don't know better, you might wind up paying $7 for a cab ride that should've been $3, big fucking deal.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It's understandable, too--even if you're a poor American, if you're in their country to begin with, you're probably rich by Thai standards. Their minimum wage amounts to the equivalent of $10 total for a full workday. If we had aliens coming to our country who were comparatively as loaded, we'd be trying to snag their money, too.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">And even when they're trying to \"rip you off\", it's sort of a game--they do it good-naturedly, not with any true ill will. Alex and I have gotten considerably better at haggling, which is kind of a sport. You smile, you shit-talk, you act shocked and affronted, but always while smiling. A woman will pretend to be angry, turn to Alex, and point at me, saying, \"She want for one hundred baht! She make joke for me--beautiful, but no very smart.\" A man will plead desperately that our asking price is lower than what he himself paid for an item...but eventually he'll budge, because, after all, he was lying, and knew that we knew it.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Another reason I want to get out of Chiang Mai is because I'm starting to become unfairly cynical towards the other tourists here--at least the ones I perceive as belonging to the same category of tourist as the rich kids pouring into our guesthouse lobby each day.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">So many people here seem to want an experience that is \"authentic\", but also easy. We've met people who will complain of all the tourists, or how the hill tribe treks aren't \"authentic\" and are \"commercialized\" and designed to get you to buy stuff [...no shit, you're&nbsp;<em>paying money</em></span><em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">to go point and stare at a bunch of people in their \"natural habitat\" like they're zoo animals]...and will then complain, \"Yeah, I went to Myanmar, but over there there's like, no Internet and it's hard to find ATMs. And <em>no one there spoke English.</em>\"&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Dude, fuck you.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Last night, after hanging out for a while eating chicken hearts and livers with Nathan [whom we'd met earlier] and a couple who'd recognized Alex's shirt from Burning Man, Alex and I got legitimately drunk for our first time in Thailand, which served as a good release valve for me to let off some of my frustration. I went around, sneaking up to trashed Euro bros pissing on fences, spitting beer into their pee streams from the other side, yelling \"Bpen ngai bang?\" and running away as they squealed in surprise, and otherwise fucking with people and being a twerp, albeit a harmless one. I predict something similar happening tonight.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">All in good fun?</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">One conversation we had left me feeling a lot better about everything. Over&nbsp;</span><em>kao soi&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">we overheard a white guy [who may have been a Kiwi, but we couldn't tell for sure] reading one of the menus in Thai, and struck up a conversation [since I'm at the point now where I can slooooowly read pretty much anything in Thai, as long as the font isn't too weird]. He was an odd character: he seemed like he would've been in place in Silicon Valley, a mildly outdoorsy nerdy engineer type, but had spent much of the last couple decades wandering into random small Thai towns and hitchhiking.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">He was very friendly, but avoided talking about himself. When we asked him why he was here, whether he was working or living or traveling, he'd said, \"Oh, you know, it's easy to live here,\" and changed the subject.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">But he took an approach to Thailand more simple and organic than any other travelers we'd met. \"I haven't been on one fucking trek, I haven't ridden an elephant. I just talk to people, eat, and wander around, see what there is to do. I trained in Thai massage for a while and practiced at a couple temples. It's just living--like living anywhere else. This isn't some 'other' place--some fake world, or theme park, as many like to treat it.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">After a long chat by the cart, he introduced himself as Matt, got up and went along on his merry way, matter-of-factly. It felt a lot more genuine than some of the awkward partings we've had with others, sprinkled with, \"Oh, I need your contact info,\" or \"Yeah, I'd love to hang out again,\" that aren't so much sincere as they are ways to make the goodbyes a bit smoother. Having one great conversation with someone can, but certainly doesn't always, mean you'll have anything to talk about given a \"next time\". Figuring out how to tell the difference between what should be a one-time encounter and what could be a life-long friend is a bit of a challenge, but I've been getting better at it.</span></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n       [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1600\"]<img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417933868535-WULO1NEM62YX1RA6V3HG/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\" Spirit House in Your House's lobby \"/>  Spirit House in Your House's lobby [/caption] \n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><span style=\"font-size:14px\">One of my favorite experiences so far has actually been of a completely failed plan to visit the quarry, a sort of obscure local secret-ish, supposedly a great spot for cliff jumping and swimming.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We rented a scooter, got about twenty minutes or so out of town, and got a flat. The next several hours consisted of us pushing the thing along the side of the highway, looking for gas stations, filling up with air, and driving another 3 k or so until the tire flattened out again, then continuing to push it.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;An ex-pat on a bike came by and helpfully went off to investigate where the nearest gas stations were [and check to see if any of the repair shops were closed--they all were], and we found a few cool knickknacks lying in the sidewalk, and had our antics laughed at good-naturedly by passing locals crammed in the back of pick-up trucks.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Eventually, we managed to spot, and hail, a&nbsp;</span><em>songtaew</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;that could take us back into town--though, knowing we were desperate, she wouldn't budge from 200&nbsp;</span><em>baht.&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We really had no leverage, though, so we shrugged and laughed this off.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It's the conversations and revelations we had, and the dumb shit we laughed about, during those few hours that I think I've gotten the most out of.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">...Uh, so much for shorter blog posts.</span></p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>Luang Prabang, Lao PDR</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Finally, I've found a bit of what I didn't realize I was looking for.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The last few days have been slow-motion mayhem, like a bunch of inept drivers steering their cars through snow for the first time--chaotic and uncontrolled, but slow enough to buffer any true danger. A stew of misadventure and serendipity.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I didn't see it while in Thailand, but with this new contrast I understand what I've been missing:</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Thailand felt like a&nbsp;</span><em>vacation</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">. Everything was shaped around tourism. It was all easy, required little imagination, and something about it felt very false and Disneyland-esque. The main pastimes for locals and tourists alike seemed to be eating and shopping [with the secondary options of getting massages, partying, and sightseeing]. It's a place where I felt I either had to make an \"itinerary\" or else ambled around placidly, wondering what I was doing there, trying to figure out my \"role\" as a \"tourist\", feeling vaguely uncomfortable and embarrassed to be affiliated with some of the other tourists there, many of whom were behaving rather disgustingly: stomping around with a sense of entitlement, dehumanizing the natives, being indignant just for the sake of being indignant. Several ex-pats there, with pasty bellies covered with Hawaiian shirts and little Thai wives in tow, spoke less Thai than I did after being there for only two weeks, let alone read any.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In contrast, in Laos I feel like I'm actually&nbsp;</span><em>living.&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I haven't been uneasy about being a visitor here. The tourists I've encountered seem more childlike, adventurous, flexible. Even the rich kid spring breakers who are just here to get wasted on lao lao whisky seem happy and playful and basically like real human beings.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">If I won't get screamed at for generalizing, culturally Laotians themselves are a sharp contrast to Thais [who comprise many of the tourists here, as well]. They seem a lot more rambunctious and easygoing—</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><em>whoopwhoop</em>ing loudly when a power outage strikes at night, playing weird little hop-scotch games and acting like kids, singing or laughing raucously and at random, giving less of a shit and just having a good time. They're easygoing and friendly, but don't kiss our asses or seem to care much that we're here [unless they're trying to make money from us, understandably]. And not only do they have&nbsp;</span><em>really</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;good English [much better than virtually all the Thais we met], but many of them speak Thai and French as well [I've spoken more Thai here than in Thailand].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In contrast, most Thais we met, while very likeable, seem more like your average first-worlders: more polite and \"civilized\" [at the expense of being a bit stuffy or insincere at times, if you ask me...but I tend to like people who are uncouth and consider \"civilized\" a pejorative], and certainly more materialistic. Like everyone else in this globalized world, I suppose.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The hundreds of small children we've seen have all been really self-sufficient and healthy: kids as young as six pushing their bikes up a steep hill a couple miles out of town, waving to us as we pass by, wandering through the mountains on their own, helping the adults with manual labor, playing with bugs.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Everything's gone \"wrong\" or has otherwise been \"unexpected\", but it's all worked out perfectly. In Thailand I felt like a grown-up on holiday--here I feel like a Lost Boy in Neverland, laughing deliriously at how absurd life is, much more present in the moment, disinterested in checking my email or researching \"things to do\" or \"things to know\" online.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">While I really enjoyed Thailand...Laos is way, way more my bag. I haven't stopped giggling incredulously since I got here. If Alex and I were to pigeonhole our views on life, we'd probably both call ourselves absurdists...an outlook Laos seems to amplify.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The countryside is breathtaking, and Luang Prabang feels like being in someone else's dream. We want all the people we love to get their asses over here. If we had more money, we'd buy plane tickets for our closest friends and family in a heartbeat. Someday.</span><br /><br /><strong>Chiang Rai</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We left Chiang Mai for Chiang Rai [after leaving the lady at our guest house a thank-you note in Thai that was more likely than not full of mistakes, though we figured she'd find them amusing], which we thought might be a bit of a smaller, more rural version.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Not quite.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Chiang Rai, while half the size of Chiang Mai, felt distinctly more \"industrial urban\" when we first rolled in. Our bus passed several car dealerships and wove through a lot of slummy looking shops an office buildings before arriving.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">When we got off our bus, we had our first unpleasant interactions with Thai natives.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The&nbsp;</span><em>tuk-tuk</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;drivers were pushy as always, but with less good humor--several of them gestured as if to grab me and made animal noises at me, laughing and saying things like, \"get in tuk-tuk or you don't know where you're going, backpack too heavy for&nbsp;</span><em>farang</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;girl.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We kept walking and found an Internet cafe with the pushiest restaurant staff we've ever met. As a sharp contrast to the friendly and laid-back establishments in Chiang Mai, everything was very calculated: the moment we stepped up to the entrance, we were chivvied forcefully to a table [even though we said we just wanted to check out the prices outside], stood over and stared down by a notepad-equipped server before we even had a chance to peruse the menus, even when we asked to be given a few minutes; the bathrooms cost 20 <em>baht</em>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">for non-customers; the wi-fi was only available to those who made an order of at least 50 <em>baht</em></span><em>;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;the food was all unappealing Western options [pizzas, Caesar salads...not even so much as <em>pad thai</em>] and&nbsp;unusually&nbsp;pricey [about four or five times what we've been paying for meals].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We shrugged and ordered a small dish in order to get Internet access, and when Alex tried to plug in our hand-me-down&nbsp;tablet [which wouldn't turn on otherwise], he was stopped abruptly by a staff member who said it would cost 20 <em>baht</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;to plug in his phone.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Well, we just made an order so we could use the Internet.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Yes, you can use Internet free with your order, but you have to pay to use the power.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"But we <em>can't</em>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">use the Internet unless we plug in our tablet. It doesn't cost you anything to let us charge it, and no one else is using the outlets, so why do we need to pay to use one for ten minutes?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"It doesn't even matter why! It's only twenty&nbsp;<em>baht</em>!</span><em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For you, twenty <em>baht</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;is <em>so little,</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;it's practically </span><em style=\"font-size:14px\">nothing.</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\" From all the spite in his&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:14.40000057220459px\">voice, he might as well have been spitting on us.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Hey. Look. No one&nbsp;</span><em>owes</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;you money just because they have it, you still need to treat them fairly and give them a good reason to buy from you--good food, or at least friendliness. Your prices are already much more than a local would pay, there's no way a local would ever eat here, but we were still going to eat here. I'd rather give two hundred&nbsp;</span><em>baht</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;to someone else who was honest and respectful. Or at least good-natured.\" I gestured to Alex to leave.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Should I cancel your order?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Probably. We won't be here to pay for it.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Even the scammers and pushy vendors we've met have been fun to interact with, smiling and joking their way into our pockets.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Look, I fucking get it--we're tourists, and the fact that we're even <em>in</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;Thailand means we're well-off by Thai standards, even if we'd be paupers in the States. We're coming here to visit your town, often quite disoriented at first, and you're being adaptable and resourceful by capitalizing on it.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I don't even mind being ripped off [for instance, when it's obvious I have no other option but to hire the one <em>tuk-tuk</em>&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">at a remote bus station, so he overcharges me]—I can understand it, and I've laughed it off when it's happened. It's fair—the ride is still worth paying for, and in his position, I'd do the same thing.&nbsp;But at the end of the day, it's still a cordial&nbsp;interaction between two human beings.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I try to be receptive...but I'm a bit proud. I'm not going to shell out to someone who treats my presence&nbsp;with scorn and feels entitled&nbsp;to my money before I've even had a chance to cause offense, even if it means walking an extra few kilometers with a heavy pack, or settling for a lesser option.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Soon we found a cheap enough guest house to settle for [<em>Chook Dee</em>, 250 <em>baht</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;for a private room]. The place was a bit alienating—super rasta-ed out, with black lights and Lisa-Frank-meets-stoner fluorescent murals on the walls, the lower floor cafe full of Europeans with dreadlocks that looked like pythons [five feet long and as thick as my arm, weighing down&nbsp;skinny little French pretty boys in designer clothes], reggae music in the background. 420-everything. It was owned and run by a few Thais, most of whom seemed rather wary of their tenants.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Do you think the owner is genuinely into this scene, or is this his conception of what'll appeal to the tourists who come through here?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"Moreover, if this <em>is</em></span><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;his conception...is he right?\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Our room itself had a weird under-the-floorboards-seedy-bordello feel to it. Dimly-lit, dark wood. A picture of Bob Marley hung on the wall [which made me laugh]. The one small window opened out to a tiny tucked-away balcony with a bamboo bench and table you had to clamber out through the window to get to and a low roof that made you feel like you were in a secret hiding place looking out onto the street below. I absolutely loved this feature; the balcony was completely littered with other people's beer bottles and cigarette butts, but if anything this almost added to the appeal. The whole place was a bit crusty; the comforter obviously hadn't been washed in a while [jizz stains, human hair, dirt...] and we wondered if there might be bed bugs, but we resolved to embrace the whole thing.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"It's nasty. It makes me kind of uncomfortable. The other tourists staying here seem washed up and kind of creep me out. But I kind of like it...</span><em>because</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;I don't like it. Besides, every other vacant guest house is twice as expensive.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">One big difference in Chiang Rai was the blatant segregation between the Thais and the ex-pats/tourists. In Chiang Mai, there was a bit more intermingling--the town had embraced its status as a tourist destination, and there seemed to be a symbiotic relationship between Thais and foreigners, for the most part.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Chiang Rai was a lot less touristy, but still full of tourists. The ex-pats seemed to be there simply because it was a cheap place to live, and not because they actually liked the place. There were markets specifically catered to tourists, and ones specifically catered to locals, with little mixing of demographics. The foreigners were cold, deadbeat. The locals were dismissive.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We figured it'd be worth sticking around a couple days to see if our attitudes tot he place changed, and decided to look into things to do [because we'd run out of ideas after one night of exploring]. Online, the main attractions listed were the night bazaar [which we went to on our first night] and the clocktower [which was right next to our guest house]...other than that, there were temples to see, a couple uninteresting-sounding museums, and some natural sites to explore out-of-town [some of which were only really open to tour groups rather than self-guided adventures]...many of which were described as \"once pristine, but a bit trashed now thanks to inconsiderate tourists.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">\"...Well, you know, we could just spend a few days studying the hell out of Thai, and playing ukelele, spending next to nothing. If we were somewhere more interesting we'd be less motivated to study.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We were a bit homesick for Chiang Mai, but were surprised at what things we missed. The two things we missed most:</span><br /> </p><ul><li>The 1&nbsp;<em>baht</em>&nbsp;water filling stations, some of which were very hidden [at the ends of back alleys, obscured behind marketplaces, etc.] that made us feel like we'd stumbled across hidden treasure when we found them and, overtime, saved us several disposable plastic bottles and hundreds of&nbsp;<em>baht.</em></li><li>An adorable lady with a coffee truck that had a counter under the window just big enough for the two of us to sit, struggling to spell out titles on Thai-language magazines she provided, while she laughed at our broken Thai and made us the best iced coffee and tea drinks in town [for 25&nbsp;<em>baht</em>&nbsp;each]. Every time we went, she'd make us an extra free drink even better than whatever we'd ordered [a shot of special Thai coffee, or milky green tea with tapioca pearls]. We both regretted not saying goodbye to her before we left town, and she's the first person I'll look for if I go back.</li></ul><p>However, Chiang Rai had its good points:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The disdainful attitude to tourists was kind of a blessing in disguise: it made our interactions with Thais more rewarding [since we had to prove ourselves a bit first before they'd pay us any mind] and gave us more opportunity to practice our Thai [since a lot of them didn't bother learning English or putting English names on their menus--and a lot of the ones who&nbsp;<em>did</em>&nbsp;know English would pretend not to when approached by foreigners].&nbsp;A lot of the natives would stare coldly and silently at me as if to say, \"I don't sell hamburgers here.&nbsp;Are you lost, little girl?\" Then I'd read something off the sign or eke out a few sentences, and they'd smirk, visibly surprised. I'd ask to get something extra spicy, and they'd laugh incredulously, clearly thinking I was ignorant, but would throw in an extra chili. Then, when we successfully ate the food without dying and thanked them for it, they'd warm up to us, and the next time around would have a completely different attitude: they'd help us read the menus, teach us new words, or correct our pronunciation, and encourage us when we made efforts. There was something kind of American-east-coast about it all that we kind of appreciated: our interactions felt a lot more genuine, a lot less \"customer service\"-y, and in that way actually made us feel a bit&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;a part of the community.</li><li>A lot more varied merchandise than in Chiang Mai [where you see the same few products in&nbsp;<em>every</em>&nbsp;booth, much of which is sweatshop-made]. Some higher quality goods.&nbsp;<em>Much</em>&nbsp;better prices on the cheaper/generic products.</li><li>Distinctly different food. Also cheaper. And the best&nbsp;<em>som tam</em>&nbsp;I've ever had, made by a brusque but awesome Thai woman on the street.</li></ul><p>Anyway, another blessing in disguise:</p><p>A couple nights in, I woke up at about 4:30am to find Alex collecting bed bugs in a plastic cup, looking disgusted and amused.</p><p>I blinked at him for a while. \"...I told you so.\"</p><p>\"Meh. Ew. Shall we find another guest house tomorrow?\"</p><p>\"Actually, why don't we just get the hell out of here? It feels forced, like we're holding out to find reasons to be here. We both keep trying to convince each other that it's worth it, but neither of us really wants to.\"</p><p>\"...Yes. Where to?\"</p><p>\"How about Laos?\"</p><p>\"Sure. What's in Laos?\"</p><p>\"Who knows? We're idiots, we don't know anything.\"</p><p>\"Laos sounds fantastic.\"</p><p>The next day there was no one at the counter to inform about the bed bugs, so we just left the cup of bed bugs on top of our key and went on our way, following a route we'd found online that would get us to Luang Prabang by the following morning [...or so we thought].</p><p><strong>In Limbo</strong></p><p>From Chiang Rai, we took a bus for a couple hours to Chiang Khong, a&nbsp;<em>tuk-tuk&nbsp;</em>to Thai immigration, a shuttle to Laos immigration, which was a clusterfuck of paying fee after fee for who-the-hell-knows, and then were crammed into a&nbsp;<em>songthaew&nbsp;</em>with several other backpackers from different parts of Europe who--we were relieved to see--seemed just as confused as we were [\"Okay, so we're not the only suckers here, that's nice\"]<em>&nbsp;</em>at the fees, at being made fun of by the snarky bureaucrats, at the locals offering scalped tickets.</p><p>By this point, Alex and I were so delirious that we were reduced to cackling at&nbsp;<em>everything</em>: the fees we kept having to pay in three different currencies without knowing why [\"Forty&nbsp;<em>baht&nbsp;</em>because it's a Saturday! One dollar for smelling funny!\"]&nbsp;going to the ATM for&nbsp;<em>kip&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;entering a withdrawal amount of 1,000,000&nbsp;[we counted the zeroes several times to make sure we had it right since we couldn't stop giggling], the fact that we hadn't encountered food for several hours, the fact that the&nbsp;<em>songthaew</em>&nbsp;driver knew that none of us were really in a position to haggle with him [we were in the middle of nowhere, and no other drivers were around to compete with him], then the fact that we all got packed in with our backpacks like a bunch of sardines with no room to spare.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything was hilarious. In a backwards way, we were having a fucking blast. The other backpackers seemed a bit less delirious [and a lot more grumpy with the situation].</p><p>The two of us were dropped off at the bus station, which was also in the middle of nowhere. We went to go buy tickets for that night's sleeper bus...only to find they were sold out.</p><p>This made us crack up more, which seems to have become our default reaction to everything ever since crossing the border. Everything is absurd; everything is funny. A lot of Laotians we've encountered seem to feel the same way, and laugh loudly at everything [and nothing]. Maybe there's nitrous oxide pumped into the air here. Seems like it would keep the peace...and eliminate the need for social programs. Hahaha.</p><p>The sun was setting. We'd finally gotten some noodles in our system and could sort of think properly.</p><p>\"Well...we have a mosquito net. We could set up the hammock somewhere.\"</p><p>\"There are no trees. Or poles. We could sleep on a bench?\"</p><p>\"Beer first. Decisions later.\"</p><p>Facing off on either side of the bus station were two identical-looking narrow strip buildings. One contained a row of shops; the other turned out to contain a row of rooms [presumably for people like us who'd been stranded]. Instead of a lobby, we simply walked up to a window in the middle of the building.&nbsp;</p><p>It's difficult to describe what that place felt like--but it reminded me of being on the outskirts of Joshua Tree. Sort of an eerie, haunted, portal-to-hell-at-the-edge-of-the-world feeling that I nonetheless really liked.&nbsp;</p><p>The room seemed out of place--we walked in and instantly felt like we were inside of a motel in the states, rather than a guest house in Southeast Asia. On the far wall was a small Alice-and-Wonderland-esque door, which we opened, only to see find that it was actually a window that looked out onto nothing. [\"Probably a portal to an alternate universe.\"] There was a TV in the room--it had been at least a week since I'd seen a TV--and we turned it on out of curiosity. A Thai-dubbed version of \"A Walk to Remember\" was on.</p><p>We wandered out to explore. At this point, we appeared to be the only people there, and it had grown dark. Still, we heard some dancey music coming from nearby-ish. Past a thicket of trees, we could see the flickering of LEDs.</p><p>\"No fucking way. Is there a bar out&nbsp;<em>here? No one</em>&nbsp;is here.\"</p><p>We followed the blinky lights and noise, which felt reminiscent of Burning Man, and discovered where the music was coming from: on one side of an empty, lonely road, flood lights lit up a&nbsp;<em>huge</em>&nbsp;inflatable Angry Birds bouncy slide, which a bunch of kids were climbing up and rolling down unsupervised. What sounded like Thai salsa music was blaring at them from speakers.&nbsp;</p><p>We stood there for a long time, uncomprehending.</p><p>The blinky lights, on the other hand, were coming from a small bar about a hundred feet away. It was half-hidden by the trees, completely dark and silent, and looked closed except for the ropes of neon lights all around it. We walked inside, and after a moment or two a woman rolled up on a motorbike, sold us a couple beers, and led us to the back patio. A few seconds later, music came on--an alternation between Thai pop, and Justin Bieber covers.</p><p>Still giggling and delirious, we gave up on trying to make sense of anything. A small orange tomcat snuck up on us out of nowhere [I'd thought he was a huge rat at first] and stepped into my lap, meowing beseechingly at us every once in a while. He stayed there until we left, at which point I'd gotten rather attached.</p><p>To further exacerbate the feelings of \"this place is fucking eerie/haunted/otherworldly\", that night was a bit odd, as well:</p><ul><li>We woke up in the room at the exact same moment, both completely alert and under the impression that it was morning. Alex glanced at the time and said it was 8:50 a.m. We started packing up, and then I opened the door--it was pitch black and deserted outside. We checked the time again, and it was about 2 a.m. Eventually we fell back asleep.</li><li>I realized during a dream that I was dreaming [having only had one lucid dream before]—but instead of being able to take control from there, the dream turned into a mind-fuck nightmare, hit me with a crazy intense body-high that lasted after I woke up, and left me in a weird in-between state where I was still stuck asleep but could see our room, hearing freaky dream-voices of people asking to be woken up. I still remember the whole thing as vividly as if it had actually happened, but won't bother going into further detail. Then I woke up, experienced sleep paralysis for the first time [which was fucking terrifying] and, after I could finally move, had a conversation with Alex—only to realize a few moments later that the conversation had only happened in my head, and that I'd dreamed/hallucinated it, as well.&nbsp;He woke up, and then we had the conversation—in reality—that we'd already had in my head a few moments prior [which I also told him].&nbsp;In the last year I've been experiencing some rather fucked up and terrifying dream-related phenomena for the first time ever [successions of false awakenings, for instance], but this was new.</li></ul><p>We stayed up for several more hours having decidedly morbid conversations about dreams and death and how much credence, as self-proclaimed skeptics, to give the metaphysical. And about Laos: how enclosing of a place it seemed to be. As the most-bombed country in history, it's still unsafe to go bushwhacking in remote parts of Laos due to unexploded bombs. Also, in addition to being an extremely poor country, it's illegal for Laotians to hook up with foreigners, and outside of Laos,&nbsp;<em>kip</em>&nbsp;[an unstable and inflationary currency] are completely worthless and can't be converted to foreign currencies. Many Laotians working full-time with families live on about $1-2 a day, and even college-degree-holding Laotians may make just over $100 in a month.</p><p>\"So...it seems like, if you were born in Laos, you're pretty much here for the haul, whether you want to be or not. It'd be hard to save up enough money to leave, even if you get a degree, and not much chance of marrying a foreigner.\"</p><p>\"You know...I've met a lot of Americans whose families were from everywhere else in Southeast Asia, but I haven't really come across nearly as many from Laos. Well, or Myanmar. I don't think it's as&nbsp;common.\"</p><p>\"But the people we've met so far all seem so&nbsp;<em>happy</em>. Even if they're here by default rather than by choice. Minus the border officials, but border officials never seem happy.\"</p><p>\"Maybe that's&nbsp;<em>why.</em>&nbsp;They don't have as many choices, so they figure out how to be happy with the choices they do have, and the decisions they make. We're lucky enough to have the paradox of choice, so no matter what we choose, it's hard not to wonder if we could've chosen something better.\"</p><p>The bus ride the next day was hilarious and a bit terrifying. We were crammed into little upper-bunk capsule-recliners without enough room to sit up or straighten our legs.&nbsp;There were cheap little helmet-strap seat belts to keep us in place...but they were broken. So, we&nbsp;had to hold onto anything we could find in order to avoid rolling or bouncing out of our bunk. For fourteen hours, the bus wound around mountainous roads that were curvy, steep, sometimes unpaved. At points, it looked as if we were going to drop straight off sheer cliffs. We kept our shoes in plastic bags and had to enter the bus barefoot. Every once in a while, we'd stop, and everyone would stumble blearily out of the bus and go pop a squat at the edge of some magnificent canyon.&nbsp;We alternately slept [I'm amazed we&nbsp;<em>could</em>&nbsp;sleep], continued to laugh deliriously,&nbsp;and watched movies like&nbsp;<em>Mulholland Drive</em>&nbsp;[after our weird night at the bus station, we were in that sort of mood].</p><p>The scenery was incredible. We passed small villages of stilted huts and busy people, many of whom waved and grinned as we passed by, wild and lushly overgrown mountains, huge green valleys--scenes that nothing we saw on the several buses we took in Thailand could hold a candle to that left us in disbelief [\"Where the hell&nbsp;<em>are</em>&nbsp;we? Is this a real place?\"]</p><p>We arrived at the bus stop around midnight. A solitary&nbsp;<em>tuk-tuk</em>&nbsp;driver was there, and took us and two other backpackers into Luang Prabang.</p><p>It was silent. For about an hour, the four of us wandered like lost children from guest house to guest house, waking up the proprietors only to be told there were no available rooms. We were exhausted, but couldn't stop grinning at how gorgeous the town was, even in the dead quiet dark. After checking at about thirty places, Alex and I settled for a room about twice what we were hoping to pay for, eager for a bed. The other two continued on, determined to find a cheaper place.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I'm Completely Fucking Infatuated</strong></p><p>If I ever find a place more beautiful than this one, I'm moving there, no question. I might move here, eventually, if it doesn't change for the worse.</p><p>Luang Prabang is beautiful and strange and enchanting. Being here in and of itself feels like falling in love.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm at a loss. I haven't taken a single picture in town. We don't&nbsp;<em>want</em>&nbsp;to pull out the camera because we'd rather be fully present, immersed in this place, without the distraction of taking photos. Any pictures we took wouldn't do the place justice, anyhow.</p><p>And there's too much.&nbsp;We could take photos of&nbsp;<em>everything.&nbsp;</em>The whole town almost feels like an interactive museum or art piece [but also feels like much more of an \"actual place\" than, say, the more touristy parts of Bangkok and Chiang Mai,&nbsp;though Luang Prabang is also a heavily-traveled area].<em>&nbsp;</em>I guess that makes sense--the entire town is a UNESCO World Heritage Site.&nbsp;</p><p>There are the Mekong and Khan rivers, the gorgeous Secret-Garden-meandering-alleyways, colonial French architecture, stilted huts, the jenky-as-shit bamboo footbridge across the Khan that looks from town to be so much further below and so much longer than it actually is [since it's so thin]. Not a single part of this town isn't enchanting--even the poorer areas, the residences, the back alleys. And, whereas many of the temples in Thailand almost looked fake and Las-Vegas-y, with tacky restored facades, souvenir booths, and signs, the ones here have stopped us in our tracks and compelled us to stare, or to walk in [or up hundreds of stairs] to get a better look at. They feel like&nbsp;<em>real&nbsp;</em>places--the impeccably-maintained ones give you a sense of having traveled back in time, and the ruins gave you a sense of their history.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm at a loss to go into further detail, though my mind's been reeling with taking it all in. Crossing the footbridge last night, after several hours of aimless wandering, Alex put it well, \"It kind of feels like we're in someone else's dream.\"</p><p>If I had more money, I'd buy plane tickets for everyone I love most to come here, right this second.</p><p>We woke up in the morning and, before we'd even left our guest house, had been asked by a couple girls from the Netherlands to go with them to Kuangsi Waterfall, which we'd never heard of. We agreed, grabbed breakfast on the way, and spent the next half hour gathering a group of eight people and haggling with&nbsp;<em>songthaew</em>&nbsp;drivers until one would settle for our price. On the way we passed incredible terraced rice fields and so on and so forth, which made most other \"countrysides\" I'd seen look, in hindsight, like barren wastelands.</p><p>Kuangsi was the only place in Laos we've bothered with picture-taking, so far. Once there, we passed a bear rescue center with several moon bears [which I'd never seen or heard of before--weirdest looking bears I've ever fucking seen], then jumped off trees and small waterfalls into into bright turquoise water that didn't look real. There were several tourists here, but of a different ilk--it was a lot of adults acting like kids, making friends with strangers despite language barriers [you don't need to speak the same language if you're just jumping off waterfalls together and laughing at one another's belly flops], excited to be there, and the site was clean despite the large number of visitors. After that, Alex and I climbed up to the top of the enormous falls further along--an uphill climb very few visitors seemed to want to bother doing.</p><p>When we got back, we only had to walk for a few minutes before a Laotian guy on a scooter asked us if we needed a room and told us he ran a guesthouse, handing us business cards/maps and asking us to follow him. I recognized the name of the place as one of the guest houses we'd tried during our late-at-night-asking-around, so we followed him, and he showed us to a really nice room at the cheapest rate we'd found in town so far. I kept waiting for a catch, but there didn't seem to be one, and we're still staying there.</p><p>I might as well stop here. It's really a place that defies description.</p><p> </p><p>Notably, I haven't seen a single beggar here, nor anyone who appears poor, or otherwise destitute or unhealthy. It's almost suspicious. It looks so clean here [front-of-bar puke piles notwithstanding].&nbsp;</p><p>Not sure how long we'll be here...currently wishing we'd gotten longer visas [we've only got a month], but we're running out of money anyway.</p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>Luang Prabang, Lao PDR</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Baby chicks and goats. Bamboo scaffolding. Happy kids eating shit on bikes. Women gathering river weed from the Khan and Mekong to sell at the market. Leaves bigger than I am. Families cooking their dinner in quiet back alleys. A dissolving of status and borders impossible to find in Thailand.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Leaving this place tomorrow morning. Our guts today said, \"Move\", and so we must obey.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I'm sad to leave. This place is more magical than I could ever bother trying to convey in words or photographs. The best, most ridiculous, most enriching experiences are—as usual, when life's at its best—the ones I can't even begin to write about, that'll have to be on reserve only for my closest friends, and only in person in the right setting: over a beer or a long drive or food on a subdued night in.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14.40000057220459px\">So...I'll talk about the food.</span><br /><br /><strong>Gastronomical Nirvana</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The food. Holy shit. Here, you can experience some of the best and most interesting fine dining for the same price you'd spend on a meal at In'N'Out at home.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For one thing, there's&nbsp;Tamarind, our favorite restaurant [definitely here, and possibly everywhere].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We got dinner there, seated outside, right over the Khan River. Friendly waitstaff excitedly explained all the food to us. Water was served in glass bottles to reduce waste [there is a&nbsp;</span><em>lot</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;of plastic waste from packaging all over the place here--especially since everyone buys bottled water] and drinks came with bamboo straws that could be washed and reused.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Anyway, we'd gotten a fixed-price meal, which had included:</span></p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Chilean wine and a ginger/lemongrass drink</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">A soup with bamboo shoots, pumpkin, mushroom, basil, green onion, aubergines...</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">A platter of dishes including local river weed [my new favorite thing], tomato dip, eggplant dip, chili and buffalo skin dip, the best pork sausage I've ever had, buffalo jerky and, of course, a thing of&nbsp;</span><em>khao niaw&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">[sticky rice]</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Chicken wrapped in lemongrass, local Mekong fish grilled in a banana leaf, served with a tart/herby peanut sauce</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Stir-fried pumpkin with onions, spices, and mint</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Purple sticky rice with coconut meat, amazing Lao cookies that sort of taste like a cross between rice crackers and french toast [colloquially known by Laotians as \"cat poo\" because that's what they look like], and sweet/sour tamarind sauce</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Local coffee with condensed milk and ground tamarind seed, and smoked green tea</span></li></ul><p><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">ALL of that...for two people...for a TOTAL of about $30. [Also, it was some of the best food we've had, ever.]</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We went back for the \"Adventurous Lao\" set menu, which you have to book a day in advance and put down a deposit for [because they shop for ingredients at the local market,&nbsp;</span><em>just</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;for you, that same morning, based on your preferences, allergies, and \"how adventurous\" you are, and then create a custom menu for your dinner]. They warned us that sometimes the menu might contain bat, or pig blood, or whatever--it all depended on the morning markets. We told them to go nuts.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">This was our dinner:</span></p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Bael fruit cinnamon drink and tamarind cooler</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Platter of eleven dishes: sour unripened red plum mash, barbequed plum with chili, rice powder with ginger and sugar, pig skin pork crackers, steamed local bitter greens and mushrooms in herbs and fermented fish sauce, oyster mushrooms in coconut milk, barbecued water bugs with chile [the bug dishes actually wound up being among my favorites, and this one was&nbsp;</span><em>really</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;fucking spicy], pumpkin leaves, baby jackfruit with long beans, grilled and seasoned river leaves at the banks [this was one of the only things I had trouble with—it tasted more like mud than food], river weed paste with chilis [one of the strangest textures of any food I've had—almost like pudding, but a lot slimier...basically, it's fresh green sludge from the bottom of the river].</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Platter of ten more dishes: fermented fish sauce with chili/lemongrass/eggplant/bamboo [this was the only thing we couldn't stomach], fresh river weed powder with garlic, raw baby ant eggs with herbs [sort of like spicy ceviche?], bamboo worms fried in garlic and kaffir lime, snails with oyster sauce, buffalo and pork meatball, pickled raw fish, a sweet dried pork thing I recognized as one of my favorite Chinese foods when I was a kid [called&nbsp;</span><em>ro sung</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;in Chinese], barbecued pig brains, pickled raw pork in a banana leaf.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Grilled pork stuffed in zucchini flowers, and two soups: sour local fish tomato soup [where you ate the whole fish--bones, head, and all], spicy frog soup with chunks of pepper wood [you'd chew the wood without eating it to get the pepper flavor, and the thing basically contained a whole frog, skin and all, in frog broth].</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Six desserts: more purple sticky rice with coconut, more cat poo cookies, these incredible sesame/palm sugar/peanut wedges, pumpkin custard, grilled rice powder and coconut sugar things, and sticky rice banana balls.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Also, they gave us shots of their own honey lime&nbsp;</span><em>lao lao</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">, on the house.</span></li></ul><p><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We couldn't even come close to finishing, though we tried [minus the fermented fish sauce, everything was actually good as well as interesting]. For BOTH of us, the meal ran $32 total. A custom fucking meal.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Anyway. We'd be there tonight, but they're closed on Sundays.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">As is Saffron Cafe on the Mekong side of town, also worth a mention, and also a place we'd be today if it were open: easily some of the best coffee I've ever had. I'm not really into mochas but their Luang Prabang Malt Mocha&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The founder, David, an American ex-pat, worked out a deal with some of the local hilltribes who'd been reduced to slash-and-burn agriculture [which is both highly inefficient for those practicing it, and detrimental and unsustainable for the land upon which it's practiced] after their former livelihoods of opium production became outlawed. Since then, the hilltribes have become extremely impoverished [not to mention that they're made a spectacle of by \"treks\" to their villages so that tourists can photograph them and basically act like they're at a human zoo]. These hilltribes live in areas ideal for coffee production, so basically, David gives them coffee trees, which they cultivate and hand-harvest, and then he buys the beans back from them. The resulting coffee is fantastic.&nbsp;</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The street food here is noteworthy, too. Surprising, delicious...and&nbsp;</span><em>healthy&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">[the only possible criticism I could make against Thai street food is that it left me feeling sick after chronic indulgence].</span><em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For instance, today I got a tomato and lemon shake. Gross as it sounds, it was fucking incredible. Lao style sandwiches on baguettes have also become a favorite thing--they're big enough to split between two people, fucking delicious, healthy, and round out at about 10,000&nbsp;</span><em>kip&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">[$1.25].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Some of the street vendors are hilarious. The other night, a lady who sold us some noodles kept offering us sips of Beerlao [even before we'd agreed to buy anything] then cleared a space for us to sit down on a foam mat behind her booth. A lot of others make sassy jokes at our expense rather than brownnosing. It feels much less classist here, much more laid back.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Also, the best donuts I've ever had. And they're not at the famous French bakeries in town [we've tried them there, too]—they're on the street, for a fraction of the price.&nbsp;</span></p><p><em>Huuurrg.</em></p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>Vang Vieng, Lao PDR</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It's now been a month since Alex and I first set off from San Francisco for Bangkok though, predictably enough, it feels like it's been ages. This morning I woke up from a vivid dream of being back in my hometown, driving my own&nbsp;</span><em>tuk-tuk&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">through a blizzard [though in reality my hometown rarely gets colder than 70° F] to enroll in an intensive curriculum at a Hogwarts-esque school with the most incredible bookstore I'd ever seen, where I met an awesome girl who was an equestrian stuntwoman, hitchhiker, and organic chemist and we quickly fell into an enthused conversation about traveling, self-sufficiency versus [or in conjunction with?] love...Life, the Universe, and Everything.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I woke up, completely disoriented.&nbsp;</span><em>Why am I in a small, dark wooden box?</em><br /><br /><em>...Oh yeah. I'm in a&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">bungalow</span><em>. Somewhere in Asia...Lao. That's right. What the fuck.</em><br /><br /><em>&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It's unsusprising that I'd be in such a funk. I've just gotten over about twenty-four hours of what I suppose must have been my first bout of really vicious food poisoning [though Alex and I have been sharing all our food, and he was unaffected, so who knows where I got it from]. For about eighteen hours Alex said I was barely human, just kind of a feverish, cramping zombie; in moments of coherence I suspected somewhat dramatically that I might be dying.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Anyway, in all honesty, Vang Vieng sort of creeps me out, but over the last couple days being here has led us unexpectedly to our first major revelations on this trip. Of course, our brains have been working this whole time, trying to make sense of where we are and why, and what impacts we're contributing to by being here. Being in this city has crystalized a lot of those incubating thoughts and questions.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In stark contrast with the shiny and etheral Utopia of Luang Prabang--full of happy, healthy, and educated locals, philanthropist-conservationist-entrepreneurial ex-pats, volunteer opportunities that required very little time or money from well-meaning passers-through, and so much natural and manmade beauty it almost hurt to look at [not to mention the fucking food, which I already gushed over in my last post]--Vang Vieng appears to have become a sort of wasteland since the time when most articles we've read about it were published.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Coming here, it's easy to see that this place was once an innocuous little village, set right by the river against a beautiful backdrop of sheer green cliffs, huge natural caves, but otherwise not too different from any of the other small towns in this country.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Then with the onset of tubing it sprung up a facade of debauchery and the sort of tourism that would appeal mainly to that particular class of sheltered, spoiled spring-break-gap-year kids who feel \"invincible\" and ever-deserving of whatever they want--a rather ugly facade considering how poor of a town it still obviously is.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Then, when enough tourists started dying of drinking-drug-or-recreational-thrill-seeking-related mishaps, a whole shitton of the bars and rides were shut down by the powers that be, leaving a sparse sprinkling of bars that had us thinking, after a handful of crazy nights in Thailand and Luang Prabang, \"So...where's the supposed nightlife in town?\" Going tubing and seeing about five operating bars the whole way [and tens of shut-down establishments that obviously used to be bars, slides, and rides that were shut down for being unsafe] was similarly disillusioning. And now the locals who made their living off tourism are now still having to deal with its ill effects [arguably even more ill effects than other, similar places, considering the crowd Vang Vieng seems to attract] but are hard-pressed to find nearly as much business. While a few ex-pat bars thrive each night, the adjacent locally-staffed bars are pathetically vacant, even the ones offering free drinks for ladies before 10pm and other such no-strings specials.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">It feels like a dwindling amusement park I visited as a kid, with floundering business due to a few freak accidents [and the resulting bad press, shut-downs, and lawsuits], now devoid of families or young things and primarily full of sheisty thirty-year-old trashbags who'd wander aimlessly and hit on eleven year old girls [such as myself, at the time]. Or, as Alex put it, \"it feels like Burning Man on Monday, after the temple's burned down...all the theme camps are still up, or partially up, but almost everyone's left.\"</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Before I pontificate any more, I might as well back-track to the route we took to our present dis-ease.</span><br /><br /><strong>Disneyworld Veneer</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The bus ride into town was a charming but strange look at the countryside which brought back the feelings I had on our last, much longer, much more uncomfortable ride into Luang Prabang. Natural beauty, lots of domesticated animals and savagely happy kids running around and waving, but weird icons of darkness: on a food stand at one of our stops was a water jug full of clear liquid and several dismembered bear paws, with a tap at the bottom [what could that possibly be for?], and every so often we'd see older people broken to the point of deformation or paralysis due to working every day of their lives, walking around on their arms, their atrophied legs shriveled up into their bodies, or hunchbacked to the point of being folded entirely over, looking jaded [possibly doped up on opium, which&nbsp;</span><em>is</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">legal for older citizens, broken by a lifetime of work, to smoke in order to ease their pain]. Even the knowledge that the gorgeous, perfectly-preserved mountainous countryside all around us was probably in such pristine condition largely due to the fact that the undeveloped parts of the country are literal minefields made its beauty feel a bit sinister.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Upon arriving, our first few couple days consisted mainly of vignettes of \"paradise\" that effectively distracted us from our deep-down feelings that there was something wrong with this place [and made us reluctant to admit these feelings to ourselves and one another].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We arrived, and almost instantly found a lovely bungalow, much nicer and more accommodating than any room we'd stayed in so far, for half the price we'd been paying anywhere else.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">On our first night, we ran into about eight different people we'd seen before previously on our travels, and an unintelligibly drunk Londoner insisted upon buying us tequila shots before we slithered on our way. Several bars hand out free drink vouchers and have free Ladies Night specials every night where I can just walk in, order a mixer, and walk back out, and several bars will proffer free shots of</span><em>lao lao</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;if you ask. However, what little nightlife there was along the main drag seemed pretty fucking trashy and sad and full of overdrunk douchetools, so we'd mainly just go hang out back at our guest house, which was complete with a garden hammock hang-out spot where we had several nights of long conversations with other passers-through from New Zealand, Germany, England, and an unlikely eighteen-year-old Sacramento stoner who worked for two years in order to leave the country for the first time and travel solo around the world for a year and a half [or longer, depending on the work he could find abroad].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The next day, we walked right through a massive herd of cows and a couple miles out of town into rice paddies and virtually empty countryside, scrambled up Pha Poak [small but rather steep, with no clear route except for some jenky-ass wooden ladders--we only saw one other tourist headed up on our way down, and he looked like he was halfway dead from exhaustion] for an incredible view of the town, the fields, small villages on the other side, and the towering cliffs nearby.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">A mile or so more of walking through lush jungley forest past water buffalo took us to Lusi Cave, the largest and prettiest natural cave I've been in so far, which has a lagoon you can swim in in the pitch-dark about an hour's walk in from the entrance [though it's currently dried up, so we didn't wander in that far].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Several dogs roam about freely [as they seem to all around Thailand and Lao], but here they seem especially friendly despite having no obvious owners. A group of four puppies followed a few Germans back to our guesthouse and wound up frolicking around the garden all night. On one evening we encountered a random, unsupervised cage with two monkeys on the street; the smaller of the two made grabs at my fingers and skirt [eventually he nabbed a bit of my hair, examined it, and put it in his mouth before getting bored of it and tossing it aside] and we couldn't quite figure out why they were in there, nor how we felt about it--amused but sympathetic and a bit disgusted.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Of all days to bring our camera with us, our first couple here easily would've yielded better photos than any we've taken so far...but we decided not to bother, and figured we'd rather just remain present, as we've done throughout most of our stay in Lao. Something about lugging around and pulling out a camera here feels kind of cheap.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Then we decided to go tubing, since that's sort of the obligatory \"thing to do in Vang Vieng\", which is where we really started noticing how much of a wasteland this place seems to have become. We made a point to head out early enough so that it wouldn't be too crowded...on the contrary, almost no one else was around. About five bars were in operation [with fit Lao boys throwing ropes out to fish for tubers, which we'd then grab in order to be pulled into shore--a procedure I found hilarious], several abandoned buildings nearby indicated where other bars once were, and several ladders and ropes indicated rides or jumps that had been shut down as safety hazards. The river was so slow that we spent most of the time paddling ourselves in order to move at all, and despite getting started before noon, we struggled to make it back by the 6p.m. deadline in order to avoid a fee from the tube rental shop. Additionally, it suddenly became freezing fucking cold [granted, the river being cold, slow, and deserted may have had more to do with the time of year--despite this being high season].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">The one more-than-redeeming highlight of the day [the highlight of being in Vang Vieng, in general] was when we stopped over at one deserted bar and wandered further back when we saw a steep set of stairs and ladders leading up a cliff to a platform about a hundred or so feet up. We walked past a see-saw [which we were terrible at, since I'm half Alex's size], a bunch of tame baby bunnies that didn't seem to mind being pet, and several domesticated birds [geese, ducks, turkeys, chickens, huge tanks of hatchlings...and one of the weirdest, ugliest birds I've ever seen in my life, which I could only describe as a Durkey], clambered up the ladders and stairs to the platform, which yielded an incredible view, and then noticed a small cave entrance that would've been all too easy to miss. We clambered in and it was gorgeous, with natural bridges we could clamber across and a lower pit we could get to down a ladder, sunlight filtering through in such a way, illuminating shimmering mineral deposits and lush green mosses, that it looked like a fucking Dwarf Palace.</span><br /><br /><strong>Looking Backstage</strong><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">After a few hours of paddling our arms frantically through frigid stillwater and increasing winds so as to make it back by 6 p.m. we realized aloud: there's nothing to&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;here except the standard \"adventure tour\" drag [mainly treks, or trips up to caves, most of which charge an entrance fee and some of which, that we'd previously read could be explored alone, require going with a guide--probably after enough tourists fucked up and died, as the trend here seems to be] or get wasted, and neither of those things aren't all that worth the trip compared to other places where they're better. The town at least isn't so much a real place where one can just</span><em>be</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">, relax, learn about, and appreciate; it's a broken-down Adventuretime facade. The natural geography here is really magnificent [which is probably how all the tourism cropped up here in the first place] but it's being exploited for cheap thrills.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">We walked back home where we were intending to just get changed out of our wet clothes before heading out into the night, but both inadvertently passed out, exhausted. A few hours later I woke up at the onset of a fever, severe cramps, and delirium. Yay, food poisoning [or whatever].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">A little over twenty-four hours later, as I was lying still and becoming a human again, Alex began a monologue that I've transcribed below. A bit later, when I felt well enough to speak fluently, turned into an extended conversation we've been ironing out ever since.</span><br /><br /><em>You know, when we first got here I just thought, 'Wow, this place is so much more wild and 'authentic' and rugged, I'm really enjoying this, blah, blah, blah.' But after a while, after the egocentric thoughts kind of dwindled, I'm realizing what I really think of this place.</em><br /><br /><em>We got here, hating on Thailand's full moon parties and easy access and shit, but now I feel like...that's kind of where we&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">belong.</span><em>&nbsp;On some developed island, drinking cocktails rather than trying to fool ourselves into thinking we're doing something more \"dignified\" and \"earnest\".</em><br /><br /><em>At least in Vang Vieng, the locals look at us with this ugly mixture of hope, bitterness. Especially some of the older ladies here who've obviously worked hard their entire lives, too old now to figure out a way to adapt to our presence here. We walk by, I'll smile and offer a '</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">sa-bai-dee</span><em>,' and they'll just stare with this...indifference. But not just a fly-by not-noticing, but more a profound, conscious dismissal.</em><br /><br /><em>Even those who benefit, the tuk-tuk drivers and the vendors who smile and call out next to all the competing stands next to them that look exactly the same, beseeching us, \"Please give us your money, you have so much of it and we need it,\" are basically bottom-feeders--here they're too desperate to brush off the tourists who decide to be assholes, or who insist on haggling harder than is fair, when it's inappropriate. They're not prospering off tourism. Here they still kiss all our asses no matter what bullshit we put them through or how dehumanizing we are...they may be benefiting more, but they still seem like slaves, just 'house niggas'.</em><br /><br /><em>Other tourists have been making me mad, and embarrassed, even for small transgressions. Ignorant jokes. Making cracks about hooking up with the prettier local women, like that's all they exist for. Getting angry when an impoverished Laotian--who might be illiterate in their native language--doesn't speak English, French, or whatever. Cultural insensitivity--even with signs in English asking them politely to wear shirts while they're in town. Throwing their cigarette butts and trash in beautiful places just because they're above keeping the place nice. Getting indignant when the cheap-ass comercial tour they paid for--that might cost the equivalent of a Lao person's wages in two months of working seven-day weeks--isn't \"authentic\" enough, or when everyone seems to be \"trying to sell them things\". Feeling entitled to 'local prices' and then not even realizing when they're already being&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">offered</span><em>&nbsp;those 'local prices'.</em><br /><br /><em>It's all pandered to them, too. Like the narco-tourism. It wasn't shut down because it was harming the locals...it was shut down when enough tourists died that it was making people hesitant to visit.</em><br /><br /><em>This facade's been created. Other tourists here are so detached. We were detached, too, when we first got here. No one comes to Vang Vieng to learn about the history or culture of this place. What history or culture? All you can see here are the detrimental effects of a failing tourist industry on a small third-world town that had the misfortune of being located in a beautiful place. And we were originally going to look into volunteering here...but volunteering around this town is SO much more expensive than being a tourist, even a somewhat extravagant one.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>And here we are, falling asleep in this cozy tourist bungalow designed to look like the real thing while actually being much more comfortable, in a country built on fields of opium poppies, land mines, skeletons of war, and a nebulous government that everyone's too scared to even talk about.</em><br /><br /><em>We're invincible, coming here with our money, even if we're middle-class back home. Even across the world, if we get sick or get hurt, we'll be taken care of. For a pittance we can get private rooms, clean water, showers, and stuff ourselves with food.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>People come here and pay to ride abused elephants or dehumanize and gawk at the hilltribes, who are some of the last strongholds of cultural isolation in a globalizing world. Then they complain that it's not \"authentic\". You don't need to hire a guide and go take photos of them to realize what's happening or to sympathize with them for being exploited and rendered as impoverished by outside forces. Even though we're not participating in those things, to a lesser degree, we're not exempt from that either. Even with less money than most people bring here, even by making an effort to learn and do no harm, we're still living it up, we've still got nice backpacks, and are still monetary miles above the standard here. I think it's important to understand this.</em><br /><br /><em>If you want an \"authentic\" experience, fucking go home and buy a sandwich at Subway.&nbsp;For the people here, it's just&nbsp;</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">life</span><em>, and it's harder than just about anyone comes with would ever want to subject themselves to--or would know how to handle. Some of the volunteering costs so much money because even the well-intentioned people who come to volunteer don't have the grit to do it without some of their first-world creature comforts, and don't have the skills to actually be all that useful. They come with philanthropic ideals molded more around their egos than around a true ability or willingness to be helpful.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><em>Now I remember why I do this: to try and make a bit more sense of what's happening in the world. It'd be delusional to think I could get some simple, clean, final answer--that'd be impossible without knowing the history, goings-on, secrets, and interactions within and between everywhere in the world, which in itself is impossible knowledge.</em><br /><br /><em>But we just come into the world--poof!--as another consciousness. Here we are. Why? Why do I have what I have? What does someone over there have? What's going on? Over here, over there? Are we all puppets, is there Free Will, is it beneficial to think there is even if there isn't, blah, blah, blah...?</em><br /><br /><em>And I don't know what to do, what I can or should do--if I should do anything. But I can travel, and learn. I don't know what else to spend a lifetime doing. Or at least this part of my lifetime, while I might have so much time and still know so damn little.&nbsp;</em><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">He voiced my own solidifying thoughts and feelings at least as well as I could have, so there they are.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">And, duh. Luang Prabang and the major hubs of Thailand we've visited so far are, of course, also touristy as fuck--but there seems to be more of a symbiosis there between the locals and tourists. It doesn't seem so toxic.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">In most places we've been there's some semblance of mutual respect and appreciation, and even a lot of social crossover--we spent a good portion of a night in Luang Prabang playing music on the street with some Laotians, one of whom unwittingly led me to my gnarliest hangover ever when he kept offering me shots of</span><em>lao lao</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;and ignoring my laughing pleas of, \"No more!\" Similarly, the nightlife and partying and narco-tourism is rampant there, but it doesn't feel dark or thoughtless, rife with stories of overdose or exploitation--it feels more like what partying should be.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">And Thailand, while overrun with a different sort of ex-pat [i.e., perverted old men with young Thai girls, or people who just wanted to retire somewhere cheap, irrespective of where it was] and some other unpleasant variables, seems less tainted in that it decidedly&nbsp;</span><em>isn't</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;a third-world country the way Lao is, the people there aren't so desperate and taken for granted by entitled tourists flaunting their wealth here in a third-world country by wearing impractically decadent designer clothes, trying to haggle for set-price wet market items for the sake of saving an extra twenty-five cents because they're fucking idiots and don't know better and mistakenly think that no items are above haggling or that everything is dishonestly priced, knowing that sooner or later one of the reluctant food merchants will relent because, after all, beggars can't be choosers. In Thailand, when someone tries to do that, the vendors just laugh them off, and rightly so.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">I didn't feel dirty for being in most of the places we've been so far [though coming to terms with \"being a tourist\", not deluding myself into thinking I could be something more dignified by trying to \"avoid the tourist stuff\" or \"rough it\" more, and embracing my role as an inescapable fact took me a second], whereas coming here has wrought us with an uncomfortable sort of guilt...a feeling that we really don't</span><em>belong</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;here, that our presence is doing a lot more harm than good.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Anyway. Time will tell what we might actually&nbsp;</span><em>do</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;with our evolving thoughts and attitudes, but for now we're still learning, trying to stay humble, to \"see with eyes unclouded\" and not delude ourselves into thinking we're \"above\" all the bullshit...while also not being too hard on ourselves.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">For now, I'm excited to get the fuck out of here tomorrow: the general plan is Vientiene, hop over the border to Nong Khai, then on to Southern Thailand via Bangkok in order to visit a few people and get scuba certs.</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">Of course, as usual we've been playing by ear a lot and our \"plans\" have been changing every two days or so, so fuck if I know whether that's actually what we'll end up doing [or, if so, how long it'll end up taking us--two weeks or six].</span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-size:14px\">One side effect of all the Bangkok protests we've just found out about that's proved very serendipitous for us is that Americans entering Thailand by land can now stay visa-free for thirty days. A week or two ago, it was fourteen days--we would've had to fly in in order to stay the full thirty for free, so we'd resigned ourselves to hunting for as cheap a flight as possible from Vientiene into Bangkok and skipping Nong Khai, which would've been a shame since it's&nbsp;</span><em>right there</em><span style=\"font-size:14px\">&nbsp;from Vientiene and was recommended by a \"credible stranger\" who didn't really tell us anything about it except that we should go there. I tend to prefer following random and vague suggestions than well-defended ones, which is probably why we didn't bother going to Pai when we were in the neighborhood-ish--too much hype from too many backpackers either yammering about how amazing it was, or about how overrated and overrun it was.</span></p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><strong>Melbourne, Victoria</strong></p><p>I've been having really good luck with airplane seating arrangements.</p><p>From Kuala Lumpur to Melbourne, Alex and I were seated next to Stephen, an energetic man of about fifty who owned a decorating company in Victoria. I'd had the audacity to ask Stephen a lot of frivolous, covetous questions about how he managed to get a brownie from the flight attendant even though they weren't on the menu; this had proven to be a good move on my part, as he was awesome, and we spent the rest of our flight rambling at each other about the cultural and political absurdities of our respective countries.</p><p>He offered us a ride--which was fantastically lucky for us, since we'd arrived at around 2:00 a.m. and were thinking our only option would be to hire a cab--then, after a rather amusing series of trivial setbacks, handed us a card saying to let him know if we wanted to get a coffee or wound up needing an alternative place to stay, and warily left us in front of a dark and unassuming warehouse facade in Coburg as per our request [and repeated assurances that, yes, we were at the right place, and yes, we knew the people who lived there].</p><p>Since then, I've gone on one other flight, from Adelaide to Melbourne [having previously taken the train from Melbourne to Adelaide--aboard which I was probably the only passenger under sixty, and wound up making a throng of very sweet and inquisitive octogenarian friends who were completely intrigued by this girl dressed in fluorescent clothes she found in Thailand, and was subsequently offered well-wishes and blown kisses and vague grandma-esque insistences that I ought to visit their town by about fifteen of them upon disembarkation], during which a flight attendant handed me a flirtatious the-seat-next-to-me-is-empty-if-you-want-to-come-take-it note from a spiffy admirer about whom I knew nothing except that he was tall, dark, and from Texas, but regrettably didn't wind up rewarding this admittedly charming gesture [sorry, bro] because by that point I was already enmeshed in a fantastic conversation with a one of the most interesting guys I've met in a while. We talked about Burning Man [a given when you both realize you've both been], travelling adventures [including his experience playing music and doing a peyote ceremony up in the foothills near a remote Mexican village, and being working with locals to open up a restaurant in Indonesia], a new wave of surreal, transcendently immersive \"performance art\", and so on. The one-hour flight suffered a two-hour delay; the two of us drank airplane wine and carried on, not minding a bit, and once again I was spared the necessity of transit fares and offered a ride home.</p><p>Anyway, back to that dark warehouse in Coburg.</p><p>Getting in required stepping gingerly through a hole in one fence, ducking under a hole in another, and heading up some stairs sprinkled liberally in broken glass, which had recently occupied the now-broken pane in the door of the loft we'd get to stay in. I was delighted--something about having to sneak in in the dead of night just pumped my nads.</p><p>Inside was a large bed [which, after the cheap-as-shit-but-consequently-shittily-uncomfortable three-day journey from Ko Tao, rendered me almost psychotically excited even in my exhaustion] with a cheery note from Alex's friend Tim, pointing out where we could find a clean towel and sheets hanging to dry, and that there was a particular surprise for us hidden in the room [which we found--and which I'm keeping a secret]. The room was strewn with boxing gear and an assortment of books that demonstrated [in my opinion] very good taste on part of their owner. On one wall hung a large, aquatic-patterned sheet to encourage privacy and insulation. It was perfect.</p><p>Funnily enough, that was two weeks ago, and I still haven't met this guy whose bed we're staying in.</p><p>As for the place, Reclamation Artists Warehouse is still in its infancy--mostly an empty space, though intended to become something of an industrial arts workshop/party venue [not unlike the Generator near Reno, which I also got to see--and help fix up--during its bare-bones infancy and which is now one of the coolest places in America, if you ask me].</p><p>Ever since reading&nbsp;<em>Down Under</em>&nbsp;I've been on a mission to overload myself with information and see how much I can manage to remember. Combine this with how expensive Melbourne is [particularly compared to Thailand], and with its saving grace of free museums, and you can easily guess where I've been spending a sizeable chunk of my free time. I visited the NGV International&nbsp;<em>alone&nbsp;</em>on three different days before deciding I'd had enough of looking at really old things.</p><p>Otherwise, there's nothing too crazy for me to report just yet, as I've spent much of my time here focused on freelancing and haven't been able to cut loose and go on a real adventure [outside the bounds of conventional wandering, academic tourism, gastronomical overindulgence].</p><p>There've been some good nights with new friends.</p><p>On one of our first nights we were invited out by Adrian, the first photographer I've shot with in Australia, and treated to drinks on a rooftop bar rife with some really personable, easygoing people exhibiting varying degrees of artsy-fartsiness [I went home with an illustrator's drawing of a fish that had been inspired by a face I'd made], Alex and I left with a couple of art models, for a free Cat Empire show at Federation Square, and eventually we wound up drinking wine under a bridge by the river amidst several hippie types, all seeking refuge from the sudden rain [and all being barked at by rather unimposing cops as soon as the rain cleared].</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n       [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1600\"]<img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1417925761624-M8JYOJLS5BQY3NIKURWR/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\" Adrian Carmody:&nbsp;Melbourne, VIC, Australia, 2014 \"/>  Adrian Carmody:&nbsp;Melbourne, VIC, Australia, 2014 [/caption] \n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">Similarly, last night we successfully located what is undoubtedly the best ice cream place in Melbourne, followed by a contender for best cocktail bars I've been to in my life [which we only sought out because its name is also my Chinese name--we didn't even know it was a bar], followed by the swank apartment balcony of a lovely and hilarious Kiwi couple whom Alex had met a couple years prior in New Zealand, and who kept giving us wine and shots and making us laugh. The next day we nursed our consequent hangovers by seeking out the best pies in Melbourne.</p><p>In case you haven't gathered by now, Melbourne's full of good things to put in one's mouth.</p><p>And so on.

You've heard this story before.</p><p>I&nbsp;disembarked at Suvarnabhumi, one of Bangkok's two international airports. I'd flown in on a one-way ticket and&nbsp;a single sparsely-packed backpack and no plan, bringing only the clothes I'd worn on the plane and the desiccated crumbs of expired&nbsp;daydreams.</p><p>Early on, I was&nbsp;inundated with tall tales of&nbsp;the cliched&nbsp;\"life-changing&nbsp;personal&nbsp;experiences\" one can replicate&nbsp;when they've earned money, even barely any money,&nbsp;within a first-world economy. These must-do's&nbsp;read almost like a&nbsp;curriculum off some deluded syllabus for the privileged-but-\"conscious\". As usual when confronted with&nbsp;surroundings&nbsp;completely alien to me, I felt&nbsp;blissed out, delirious, and expansive, which chased away my cynicism for a time.</p><p>As if Southeast Asia were merely Disneyland for spiritual capitalists and would-be anthropologists, other English-speaking&nbsp;travelers I met on the way would share their&nbsp;reviews, with a tone&nbsp;implying that they'd&nbsp;benevolently condescended to some quainter rhythm of life.&nbsp;</p><p>Bright-eyed gap-year kids obsessively hewing together some sort of \"rite of passage\" ritual&nbsp;had become the new face of white imperialism.&nbsp;</p><p>\"Oh, it's so touching, the natives here, they have so little, and yet they give so much.\"</p><p>And, even more absurdly:&nbsp;\"Yeah, we paid to go on this guided&nbsp;trekking tour to visit one of the indigenous hill tribes, but the experience...I don't know, it was just so inauthentic.&nbsp;So commercial, you know, like they just wanted our money.\"</p><p>My allergic reaction to these conversations&nbsp;quickly propelled me&nbsp;into an infinite spiral of self-questioning.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure. I could criticize the hypocrisy of paying for an \"authentic\" experience, but&nbsp;how exempt was I, really, from similar&nbsp;criticisms? Was I merely making social observations, or were these people&nbsp;reflecting something uncomfortable in myself? Was&nbsp;I just like them? Was that why they annoyed me so much?</p><p>You've heard this before, too:&nbsp;I'd meet travelers along the way who'd had similar revelations. They'd scoff at the \"tourists\" [differentiated from \"travelers\" in their minds] who would stay at nice hotels, hire chauffeurs, and&nbsp;delight in how cheap prostitutes were.&nbsp;Meanwhile, these \"travelers\" would loaf around&nbsp;in hostels run by ex-pats from their&nbsp;home country, stocked with kids who were so like-minded that they could discuss&nbsp;worldly matters&nbsp;for hours without anyone's perspective being challenged, investigate&nbsp;the cheapest ways to get high,&nbsp;and consult their smartphones or guidebooks every time they needed to make a decision on where to go, what to eat, which \"life-changing\" experiences to pay chump change for.</p><p><em>Well...I'm not doing any of those things.&nbsp;Lonely Planet never factored into the equation for me. I'm not going on elephant rides or staying in youth hostels run by foreigners. I didn't even&nbsp;bring my laptop!...But now a</em><em>m I doing the exact same thing as these&nbsp;\"travelers\"? Creating a separation and&nbsp;looking down on them because my own protocols and motives are somehow more \"pure\"? What's the motivation behind that? First-world guilt or self-loathing? What's the point? Should I not even be here?</em></p><p>And so on, <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p><p>Here's what I&nbsp;<em>did</em> realize, though.</p><p>Southeast Asia doesn't exist for middle-class westerners who want to visit countries&nbsp;where they can pretend they're&nbsp;rich.&nbsp;It doesn't exist to proffer salvation for&nbsp;privileged millennials desperate to find enlightenment, or at least desperate to transcend their dark fate to a life of relative ease&nbsp;by constructing arbitrary \"challenges\" and adventures for themselves, all the while maintaining the safety net granted to them at birth.</p><p>It&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;doesn't exist as a serviceable substitute for having actual self-esteem. Criticizing the practices of \"tourists\"&nbsp;while exalting your own does not fundamentally separate you from them.&nbsp;Coming home and shoving your supposed worldliness in the face of your less-traveled friends, while dismissing the richness and depth of their own lives [perhaps levels of depth your own life is lacking, if you only took an honest look], does not make you worldly.</p><p>Call yourself a globetrotter, vagabond, pilgrim, or gypsy all you want, but going to another country, or twenty,&nbsp;does not define you. You are not where you've been, what you've seen, or even what you've been a part of. You're in the&nbsp;<em>how:&nbsp;</em>how you've chosen to see your experiences, how closely you've looked, and at what.</p><p>It doesn't exist for us at all. It's a place, existing in and of itself. Where people live, existing in and of themselves. They weren't put there in order to teach us lessons about consumerism or compassion or inspire us towards Eastern thought. They've got their own thoughts and their own shit to do, and none of it has to do with us [well,&nbsp;except for those who are using our tourism&nbsp;to make their living].&nbsp;</p><p>With the right attitude, this realization extends&nbsp;both liberated detachment and connection.</p><p>And, most importantly, I learned that none of the lessons I learned have <em>anything</em> to do with Southeast Asia, though going there acted as a catalyst for me. As far as the traveler-vs-tourist division is concerned,&nbsp;I've seen the same behavior in ski town transplants&nbsp;and college frats: deep down, you're not sure if you belong there, and so you haze everyone who appears to belong there even less than you do.&nbsp;</p><p>But really, the questions were mine to ponder, the lessons mine to learn. Southeast Asia didn't&nbsp;exist for the sake of my personal development [though I couldn't have asked for a more enchanting backdrop].</p><p>Perhaps people like me don't belong&nbsp;in places like Lao: Westerners, perhaps wearing brand-name backpacks and wielding cameras that each cost more than a college-educated Laotian makes in a year.&nbsp;</p><p>Or, perhaps, all of us are fundamentally world citizens who can belong anywhere, if we only figure out how.</p><p>The agitated silt in my head is&nbsp;not going to settle into answers any time soon, if it ever does, but while I'm floating in spirals&nbsp;I just hope I'll&nbsp;remember how to keep asking.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>",

All are complicated and in constant evolution and flux.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As of now, I feel less certain about anything than I ever have—but I also feel empowered in the assurance that my previous certainties were illusions. I feel like I know nothing, and I take that as a good sign.&nbsp;I know that I know a lot more than I used to, back when I felt like I knew everything.</span></p><p><span>When I began modeling, I was something of a misogynist.&nbsp;I felt that women often whined about fabricated difficulties. I had penis envy, but more than that, I wanted to demonstrate that I could be better, smarter, stronger than other women, while still being a woman.</span></p><p> </p><p><span>The shadow to this was that I was a bit of a glutton for punishment, obsessed with proving that I was tough. I wanted to be a hot chick and an alpha male. I took pride in never getting offended by chauvinism, at relating to and being accepted by men who were sexist and being an exception, being on their level, “getting it”, but not being some “gross chick”. There was no reason I couldn’t look perfect all the time and also be better than men at everything.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This made me vulnerable to self-loathing and manipulation. I held myself to an unrealistic standard of emotional stoicism, and bought into societal pressures of beauty and fussed in secret over my appearance [all the while trying to underplay my efforts so as not to seem trivial or “girly”, bragging about how little effort I’d made to look perfect].&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When I began doing photo shoots, photographers would complain about other models who were “prissy” or “prima donnas”. I would pride myself on being tough, being accommodating, not complaining—to subjecting myself to extreme discomfort at the photographer’s whim for little to no pay. I would pride myself on not being offended when photographers would say degrading things about my body--unlike those other prissy, whiny girls, I could take criticism, constructive or otherwise. I had a tough skin.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><span>Really, I just had poor boundaries and made myself vulnerable to manipulation. Those models who were “prima donnas” were models who’d learned that they didn’t need to please unreasonable demands to be valid. That they didn’t need to put their personal safety at risk, and that no photographer was entitled to their time, effort, and trust for free. When we agree to a shoot, we're trusting that the photographer will treat us decently and that he's safe, and we're forfeiting all our rights to the resulting images. If we have an alias, we're trusting he will honor that by not publishing nude photos under our legal names.</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I've abandoned that line of thought, but it hasn't gotten me much closer to answers.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">[You struggle because you are a woman, or a person of color. However, not *all* your struggles in life are the result of you being a woman, or a person of color.

Terrified and wasted, I froze up. By some weird form of divine intervention, my friend came pounding on the door, screaming, right before he was able to take my virginity.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">In order to redeem my honor, which I felt I'd compromised through my silence, I pulled a knife on this same boy when I next saw him, getting a sick rush as he began to cry and showed me that he wasn't actually tough at all.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">Back in those days, my heart had only ever been broken by girls. The whole mean-girls-high-school thing. So while I had female friends, at the end of the day, my confidantes were male.&nbsp;More specifically, my confidantes were teenage boys, inundated with pressure to be manly and tough, to do whatever they had to in order to not be called \"pussy\", victims of the same patriarchal illusions as I was. When I confided in these male friends, most of them reacted with rage--as they'd been taught was the&nbsp;manly way to care. One of them, Bricks, said, \"That fucking wanker. We're going to go and find him, tie him up, cut his balls off, stomp&nbsp;on his fucking face,\" and began interrogating me with such aggression [\"What's his full name? Where does he live, what's his address? Who do you know who knows?\"]&nbsp;that it seemed I was the target of his rage, not the coercive boy. When I shook my head and said I didn't want to go there, he shifted his tack, \"Well, what were you doing, getting drunk around this guy? Were you flirting with him?\"</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I used to not blame him because, after all, I'd thought he was hot and had made out with him drunk, so&nbsp;it was \"my fault\" and \"boys will be boys\", and I had to learn to \"be smart\".</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I adopted a combative attitude towards boys; for years I would revel in the tough exterior I stubbornly&nbsp;wore around boys I truly cared for and knew cared for me, in being a fighter rather than a lover.&nbsp;Now I don't begrudge&nbsp;him because I know that, as an individual, he suffers more than I do--but neither do I blame myself.</p>\n</div>",

I want to help.&nbsp;It's almost like the only way to win is to martyr myself, if that, even--some view those with privilege with such viciousness it's like there's no way we can escape from their bitterness and be redeemed. Like we're condemned at birth to be elitist assholes [maybe this is what *creates* so many elitist assholes--like the reflection of&nbsp;confirmation bias,&nbsp;people become the way they're expected to be], like there's no point in us even trying to understand and be allies. [Trans, color, etc.] Instead of shitting on people who have privilege and good intentions, why can't we empower those people to use their privilege by showing them how they can confer that privilege more widely to those who have been deprived of it?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">Anything a privileged person can think of doing can just as immediately be shot down simply because it may seem disingenuous or in some way self-serving. They're just doing it as a publicity stunt, a sales gimmick,&nbsp;or for a tax write-off. But anything we do IS in some way self-serving, no matter what: we want to change the world in accordance to our hopes and values. Because to create positive change outside oneself is&nbsp;validating, and fulfilling.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">We're BORN as \"part of the problem.\" Just by being born in a suburb in California, my life, by default, is built off the oppression of others, off the corruption of the rich who benefit from the existence of even a moderately&nbsp;consumptive person in my town,&nbsp;and off the degradation of the environment.&nbsp;Ignorance doesn't equal innocence, but it also doesn't equal guilt.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">The best way to empower people isn't to tell them how evil they are by virtue of factors and conditioning that wasn't in their control--but by infusing them with hope that they are in a position to create positive change. [Of course, this gets subverted into lies and marketing]. Guilt doesn't work.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I grew up with so many people who defend themselves by thinking, \"Well, it's not *MY* fault that I was born more privileged, and it's not *MY* fault that people are suffering because I was born into an exploitative system. Fuck you.\" And you know what? It may be cowardly of them, but I understand where they're coming from. We all want to live our own lives and seek our own happiness. I don't think not wanting to be a radical activist means someone is a bad person.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">And there IS a lot of false activism. Greenwashing ad campaigns&nbsp;that really have nothing to do with the environment [and may even cause more damage in the chase to boost sales], and is revoltingly deceptive. There is constant debate over which charities are legitimate--at this point I can think of many charities I *wouldn't* donate to; it's a lot harder to think of those that I *would*.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">What these ad campaigns and charities are selling are feel-good points, good karma, whatever--things that serve the consumer but do nothing for the world. And it's not effective, and we can scoff at people who buy into this--I used to, with bitterness--but with low transparency and with our own lives to deal with, it really can be hard to know what else to do for the betterment of people who have no direct relationship with our day to day lives.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I've been guilty, too, of scoffing at&nbsp;voluntourism, the newest wave of feeling self-satisfaction of having done something for the world. Oftentimes volunteers have to *pay* to volunteer, especially if they're doing something particularly adorable or selfie-worthy like taking care of orphaned kids or endangered animals. Volunteers often don't really help, but hinder, when they need to be trained or are additional liabilities when, really, qualified experts or&nbsp;other forms of social action would be more effective. At the same time, though, should I be scoffing? Their intentions may be self-serving, they may be seeking social validation or recognition [but since when was a desire for validation a crime?], or their efforts may be formed from naivete/ignorance, but they at the very least are not malicious, they are not seeking gain at the cost of others' rights, they're trying. Maybe what we need is to come up with better ways to try, and publicize those, rather than blaming people who might not know what else to do.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">Part of this is that there's a fallacy even in trying to save the world by consuming. Addiction to consumption is what's responsible for so many of the world's problems: we may feel bad for those child laborers or about environmental harm, but it's not going to stop us from buying our shit. I think learning where your products and food comes from is a huge start, and I take it upon myself to research these things when I can, or to get in discussions with people who inform themselves more frequently than I do.&nbsp;But there's also so much misinformation out there that it becomes hard to know what to believe. Ads manipulate us into thinking one thing. Extremists and conspiracy theorists alienate us. Media that decries VALID reporting as \"extremism\" or \"conspiracy theory\" confuse us further.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"> </p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">So far, I know of some things I can do. Small things. Take an interest in the world, read about it. Have conversations with people about what I know, and what they know.&nbsp;Don't buy too much shit. Reduce how much garbage I produce.&nbsp;Buy used&nbsp;when possible. Know where my products and food come from.&nbsp;But these things may help me not be part of the problem--how, then, can I contribute some way to being part of the solution?</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><span>And I’m at a loss. We’re so good at deconstruction, at vicious criticism. I’m constantly inundated with what I shouldn’t do, what’s stupid, self-serving, ineffective, hypocritical. But as for which things I should? That’s the hard part.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What moves you? Charity donations are one of the most intimate and powerful things I know. There are many charities I 'should' donate to, and many more people could suggest to me - but I commute my alms to things that speak to my values and my hopes, even if others consider other charities more worthy or more needy.<br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anna.mattinger/posts/2849047138743?comment_id=2849196462476&amp;offset=0&amp;total_comments=12\"><span>9 mins</span></a></span><span> · </span><span>Like</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anna.mattinger?fref=ufi\"><span><strong>Anna Mattinger</strong></span></a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/roscoe.mathieu\"><span>Roscoe</span></a>: That's the thing--while I can categorize many issues are more or less \"important\", there still remain countless ones that move me, and that align with my values and hopes. It's difficult to choose, which is why I'm casting the net and seeing, out of what's thrown up by others, which ones stick onto me [and which ones also seems like viable agents to aid their purported cause].</span></p><p style=\"margin-left:36px; margin-right:0px\"><br /><br /><span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/anna.mattinger?fref=ufi\"><span><strong>Anna Mattinger</strong></span></a> It's easy to get discouraged by negative media, and constant insinuations that privilege is something akin to Original Sin. A lot of people deal with this by posting topical status updates to illustrate how educated and indignant they are--maybe criticizing other people who \"aren't doing anything\". Like sprinting towards progress in a hamster wheel. Even looking at the comments posted so far--there are a squillion different things people want to change.</span></p><p> </p>\n</div>",

[/caption] \n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong>Reno, NV</strong></p><p>The idea for&nbsp;this&nbsp;bike&nbsp;trip first made its entrance&nbsp;in the loft of an industrial artists'&nbsp;warehouse in Melbourne. Like the rogue raindrops sogging the floor, it&nbsp;had probably leaked into the room&nbsp;through one of the broken windows.&nbsp;Meanwhile,&nbsp;Alex and I were asphyxiating ourselves in the&nbsp;vortex of scummy blankets we'd built&nbsp;as a stronghold against the cold.</p><p>Our discussion turned to things we'd never done before and wanted to do, and Alex mentioned long-distance biking,&nbsp;particularly from the States through South America.&nbsp;</p><p>I cringed. My mind glued together a collage of disasters:&nbsp;being hit by a&nbsp;car, stranded in the middle of nowhere, assaulted, etc. I admitted that I'd be terrified about doing anything of the kind.</p><p>He laughed. \"Don't&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;say that's usually when you should do something?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but&nbsp;I don't know anything about bikes. I went on little bike rides with my dad when I was a kid, but it's not like I know about anything, not even specs and sizing and all that.\"</p><p>\"Well, yeah....Exactly.&nbsp;You could even&nbsp;do it alone. I couldn't afford it.\"</p><p>\"And I could?\"</p><p>\"Well, there's modeling. Bike somewhere you've always wanted to visit, with cities you've always wanted to shoot in.\"</p><p>\"That's completely insane. A logistical nightmare, just for starters.\"</p><p>Mockingly: \"Yeah, you're right....<em>You won't.</em>\"</p><p>Of course, once the idea infected my head, I knew I had to try. And, of course, once I had the conviction to try, Alex began battling his own fears of what might happen to me on the trip [which, after all, were similar to mine—that I might get hit by a car, or assaulted, or stranded, et al]. But he also knows what I need in order to be happy; he knows that I need a bit of self-validating&nbsp;chaos in order to maintain emotional stasis and well-being. That I have to show myself what I can do, in the face of my doubts.</p><p>I'm not a stranger to chasing the unfamiliar. Two days ago, we'd&nbsp;found our way to that chilly&nbsp;loft&nbsp;like aimless drivers in the night, headed faithfully along unfamiliar roads&nbsp;in spite of never seeing farther than a few feet ahead.</p><p>In fact, one reason I live the way I do is precisely because it's a release valve to the anxiety and fear I'd otherwise harbor.&nbsp;An&nbsp;inclination to skip winter for a year brought us to Southeast Asia, because we didn't have the overhead to visit our friends in&nbsp;New Zealand, and because the idea made me anxious in a visceral way.</p><p>Months later, we'd just begun to feel like Baan Mae Haad, a village on&nbsp;the tropical island of Koh Tao, was as much like home as any town we'd lived in, when a&nbsp;sudden whiff&nbsp;of dirt-cheap tickets to Australia compelled us to leave our idyllic&nbsp;beach-wandering existence&nbsp;and&nbsp;hop on a ferry, then on&nbsp;a wagon, then on&nbsp;a train, then spend&nbsp;a night fraternizing with stray cats in the station before our next train arrived after a six hour delay, haggling for&nbsp;a cab, sleeping at&nbsp;the airport, and finally boarding our flight, three days after initially leaving Koh Tao.&nbsp;</p><p>On the plane we met a&nbsp;man&nbsp;who offered&nbsp;us a ride from the airport and dropped us off, after our repeated assurances that he'd taken us&nbsp;to the right place [and, even then, only after we'd agreed to take his business card just in case we wound up in a jam], in front of a dilapidated warehouse, dressed modestly in barbed wire and a broken chain-link fence, at 2:00am local time.</p><p>The upstairs loft belonged to a guy Alex had befriended in the States years ago who was off working&nbsp;the mines. He'd left us&nbsp;a \"Welcome to 'Straya!\" type of&nbsp;note that indicated a gift under the desk,&nbsp;which turned out to be weed and rolling papers; even though neither of us smoke, the gesture had me giddy over its adorableness.&nbsp;In our seven weeks home-basing in Melbourne, during which I'd take short solo trips around the east coast, I never met our host.</p><p>The morning after our arrival, we&nbsp;walked through a maze of industrial buildings feeling a dazed mixture of culture-shock and reverse-culture-shock after our months in Asia. It was pure warehouseland, without a residence or business within twenty blocks, and consequently it was a dead silent neighborhood [if you can call it a neighborhood]&nbsp;except around 3am, when teenagers would show up to&nbsp;loudly drift and sometimes wreck their fancy new cars without fear of interruption.&nbsp;Eventually we emerged onto a main road,&nbsp;spotted a tram stop&nbsp;and waddled up to it.&nbsp;In our pockets were Thai <em>baht</em>, Lao <em>kip</em>, Malaysian <em>ringgit</em>, and&nbsp;a few US dollars. The operator&nbsp;shrugged and beckoned us aboard, anyway. Without local currency, electronic devices, local contacts in town, or any idea where we were going or how we'd find our way back, we hopped on without hesitation.</p><p>We were home again.</p>\n</div>",

My mind, body, sanity, and finances have all taken some gnarly blows.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not ready to dunk into those memories and convert&nbsp;my findings<span>&nbsp;into a blog post yet, and it's possible I'll never feel inclined to do so. For now, suffice it to say that I've been learning, and relearning, and relearning.</span></p><p>The upsides of last spring-summer-fall have been great, too, albeit largely retrospective. I've been challenged in completely unfamiliar ways,&nbsp;tapped into new skills and interests, improved my&nbsp;communication skills,&nbsp;learned not suffer for my&nbsp;sense of \"justice\",&nbsp;and climbed out of some pretty ugly messes somehow better off than I'd been before falling into them.&nbsp;</p><p>And so on.&nbsp;</p><p>Suddenly, my time is open again, my&nbsp;lifestyle&nbsp;lacking any sort of built-in structure or routine—how my days are spent and how I judge&nbsp;whether I'm spending them well&nbsp;is up entirely to my own whims, values, and self-discipline. But right now I have no close deadlines and&nbsp;no one I'm reporting to.</p><p>It's freeing, but also dangerous, especially when I'm recovering from a year's worth of wounds, subservience, and sleep debt, all of which might conspire to render me functionally inert.</p><p>Bee-lining from Arcata to the Nevada border, I originally intended to spend about five days in Reno, then about five more in the Bay Area, give or take, to tie up loose ends and decompress in two of the places&nbsp;that have vied for&nbsp;the title&nbsp;\"Home\" on my heart's compass. I hadn't saved nearly as much money as I'd hoped to&nbsp;over a year of radical frugality, so I was in a hurry to get to New Mexico.</p><p>Well, that didn't exactly happen. My car decided to freak out and sit pouting in an auto-shop lot&nbsp;for almost two weeks in Reno. Meanwhile, I grew more attached than ever to the idiosyncrasies of one of the most underrated cities in America and of my favorite&nbsp;people in it.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, that's what makes it a trap. My car broke down and took two weeks [and almost two grand that I didn't have] to fix. Meanwhile, I ran around amidst desert hot springs and trees full of horned owl chicks, got treated to all-you-can-eat sushi [which, at $15-25 a head, is fresher and better than any mid-range-to-expensive&nbsp;sushi I've <em>ever</em> had in the Bay—<em>no one ever believes this</em>, including myself from a couple years ago,&nbsp;until they come to Reno&nbsp;and are taken to precisely the right sushi spots by a local, but it's true], had a fantastic goodbye party thrown together at the last second, which got such a good turn-out that I started feeling a bit too ooey-gooey to want to leave.</p><p>Similarly, the Bay found me entangling with all the local goings-on. Visited my family and helped them decommoditize [i.e., threw away years and years of crap accumulated in the name of nostalgia—a habit that runs in my family that I've painfully had to break out of, because a nomadic lifestyle does not support hoarding memorabilia], and further prepared for my bike trip by&nbsp;learning some basic repairs at home from my dad, who's&nbsp;a cycling enthusiast. Meanwhile I was paid in chocolate milk for late-night rescue missions;&nbsp;was adopted by gaggles of gregarious gay men in bars on the Castro who stole me from the friends I'd come with; went on my biggest&nbsp;bike ride yet,&nbsp;with a climb that was brutally&nbsp;humbling [the better to kickstart my motivation for the coming months];&nbsp;<span>ate a giant penis macaroon courtesy of Hot Cookie SF;&nbsp;</span>got&nbsp;free front-row tickets to \"Margaret\", a concert&nbsp;by Jason Webley and a bunch of amazing musicians revolving around a scrapbook one of them had found in a dumpster; underground warehouse venues; watched&nbsp;nature documentaries; studied French; had unexpected and delightful run-ins with out-of-town friends.&nbsp;</p><p>I have no regrets, but my leeway to decompress is narrowing fast.</p><p>Hitting the road for one more detour: Christmas in Gerlach [missed peak season, and there's no sense in trying to move or get a job on Christmas or Christmas Eve], and then beelining it to Santa Fe, now eager to buckle down and get to work after a few extra weeks of family, friends, getting my life in order,&nbsp;and some good old debauchery.&nbsp;</p><p>It'll be&nbsp;later than I'd originally planned—but perhaps not later than I was really meant to arrive. Fingers crossed!</p>\n</div>",

For some people, it's \"practical\" to rent an expensive apartment in order to be close to their job, and it's \"practical\" to buy a nice car and be forever updating one's wardrobe in order to appear presentable to superiors and peers. In order to improve the quality of their lives, these people may justify big TVs and seventy pairs of shoes, or racking up an exorbitant tab every weekend at a mediocre bar.</p><p>And that's their bag. That's fine.</p><p>Me? I'll skip the nice car and new dresses and go for some&nbsp;good food, booze, dessert. I'll even scrimp on my other meals for a few weeks in order to do so.</p><p>The last time I was in NYC I bought raw peanuts, carrots, and avocados from a street vendor for most of my trip, and then treated myself to an awesome&nbsp;steak dinner.</p><p>Every once in a while I'll buy some nice cheese and that'll be my dinner for two nights. Nice cheese never messes with my stomach the way the cheap stuff [artificially colored and containing ingredients like wood pulp] does. Cheese shops are great because you're not really restricted by price: you can generally ask for&nbsp;a $1-4 piece of any cheese no matter what it costs per pound.&nbsp;</p><p>So, without further ado, I'm going to food-splooge on you. I am not an expert, but I <em>am</em> a raving fangirl.<br /><br />I tried a bunch of things tonight, but these were my favorites:</p><p>Glug, glug:</p><p>2012 La Cartuja, Priorat&nbsp;<br />70% Garnacha, 30%&nbsp;Cariñena<br />Spain</p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>Sweet, fresh, sort of floral nose&nbsp;</li><li>Pleasant tannins [high, but not aggressive]</li><li>Soft, young-tasting, easy drinking [neither too astringent nor too nectary]</li><li>Mineralic, but not as much as the label suggests</li></ul><p>Nom, nom:<br /><br />I wasn't a fan of penicillin mold&nbsp;until I tried St. Agur.&nbsp;<br />Tonight, wanted to branch out to a couple new blue cheeses.</p><p>Bay Blue,&nbsp;Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Co.&nbsp;<br />California</p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>Whoa,&nbsp;I'm obsessed.</li><li>Strong but bright and fresh;&nbsp;sharp but not too much of that tangy funk</li><li>Fresh mineral cave quality, not musty but like clean rocks</li><li>Makes me think of springtime...and&nbsp;of lemon cookies [there's this vague crisp sweetness, or maybe my taste buds are wonky]</li><li>Great by itself on:<ul><li>Dave's Killer Spelt Bread [toasted and cut into pieces]</li></ul></li></ul><p>Fourme d'Ambert l'Or des Dômes<br />France</p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li>Style of cheese dates back to Roman times</li><li>Got a slice from the end of the wheel, which is the strongest part</li><li>Creamier, mushroomy/umami</li><li>Buttery, buttery, buttery</li><li>Earthy, kind of peaty</li><li>Goes GREAT on Dave's Killer Spelt Bread&nbsp;with:<ul><li>Saporina Balsamic Jelly [Malpighi], House of Balsamic,&nbsp;Italy [pricey, but orgasmically&nbsp;good, and a little goes a long, long way]</li></ul></li></ul><p>Tomorrow?&nbsp;Probably homemade miso and cheap produce.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>",

    "content": "<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><span>It’s begun. From now until the end of February, I can spend virtually <em>all</em> my time preparing for my trip.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This sudden freedom-to-be-single-minded isn’t random; I’ve spent a year trying to get to this point. I’ve saved up and hustled skrilla over the last year to allow myself this cushion of time, and finagled the perfect situation: I’m house-sitting, so I get a comfortable private space with no rent, in a place with mild weather. There’s no WiFi, which has a silver lining in that it forces me to get out of the house to get online and makes me less likely to waste the time that I do spend online. Plus, I’m relatively close to two REI stores; several great grocery stores; and Planet Granite, my favorite climbing gym in the country, where I’ve just bought a one-month membership. All are within a seventeen-mile bike ride.</span></p><p><span>So, I’ve been getting emails pestering me for updates on what I’m doing, or interrogating me about my training methods, previous experience, packing list, etc.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And I’m stoked on the interest [really, I am, that’s not just me being PC—the positive reception I’ve received so far was honestly pretty unexpected and has got me feeling ecstatic] but I honestly do not have time to answer all these emails [my time on the Internet’s already being spent studying the terrain and conditions of my route down to the mile, scheduling bookings, investigating camping and making arrangements with hosts, and learning about bikes from the ground up].&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Here’s the full disclosure; hopefully it’ll satisfy everyone’s questions.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Training</span></h3><p><span>Last week and this week:</span></p><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><span>2+ long rides per week [increasing what “long” means each time; yesterday I did a thirty-mile ride, so my next ride will be thirty-five or forty]</span></li><li><span><span>2+ shorter rides per week done to my maximum capacity [anaerobic], ideally with a steep, sustained climb</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>2 rest days [meaning no long or hard bike rides], only bicycling for small, local commutes [i.e., errands like grocery runs or going to cafes to catch up on emails, or doing small loops around local trails and roads]</span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span>Cross-train daily, but particularly on rest days. For cross-training, I’ve been climbing and doing yoga at PG, and doing <a href=\"http://NeilaRey.com\"><span>NeilaRey.com</span></a> workouts at home [a fantastic site, with something for everybody: some of the workouts are far too easy for me, but others completely demolish me].</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span><span><span><span>Incorporate weight loads in some of my rides, incrementally increasing the weight.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></li></ul><p><span>Yesterday’s thirty-mile ride was my first with weight, and while I only packed ten pounds, it showed me <em>just how crucial </em>minimalist packing is going to be on this trip. If you ask me, riding with a loaded bike is worse than hiking with a heavy pack, and I know <em>plenty</em> about that: at the end of my season working for the Parks, I had to hike out our last twenty-five miles with seventy pounds on my back…and on top of that, had to drag a friend’s eighty-pound pack for the last couple miles when half our crew came down with some crazy flu. Now when I go backpacking, I’m obscenely minimal, so much so that I’d never suggest to anyone that they ought to pack as little as I do.</span></p><p><span>Some people have asked me about what computers or heart rate monitors or what have you I'm using; the answer is \"none\".</span></p><p><span>I've been using the free versions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.strava.com\">Strava</a> and <a href=\"http://ridewithgps.com/?gclid=CjwKEAiAi52mBRDkq5bX0vq1-RQSJAAq_7IGIwLqCYLDwNj3IrDNivUvkZJ7lNSvppYc9AB4WOXSoBoCJDvw_wcB\">Ride with GPS</a> apps to plan/track my rides, that's all.</span></p><h3><span>Research</span></h3><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><span>As of now, I’ve read most of <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Complete-Book-Long-Distance-Cycling/dp/1579541992\">The Complete Book of&nbsp;Long-Distance Cycling</a></em>, and have been obsessively Googling articles and watching Youtube videos to answer my questions [and, before that, to figure out <em>what</em> the questions were that I should be asking, because I had no clue].</span></li><li><span>I’ve been scouring sites like <a href=\"#\"><span><a href=\"http://www.adventurecycling.org\">A</a></span></a><a href=\"http://www.adventurecycling.org\"><span>dventure Cycling Association</span></a> and<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.greenway.org\">East Coast Greenway</a><em>&nbsp;</em>and repeatedly, neurotically plugging my route into Google maps, one chunk at a time, to check miles and terrain and make modifications. Over and over. Revising and revising. I’m finally at a point where I’ve got the skeleton for my complete tour; there’s some wiggle-room and I’ll be making some changes, but I <em>basically</em> have my dates outlined, and it’s looking like the tour will take exactly [or close to exactly] four months from Key West, FL to Bar Harbor, ME.</span></li></ul><h3><span>Diet</span></h3><p><span>Pretty simple. High protein. Aiming for about 125g a day [since I weigh between 120-125 lbs].</span></p><p><span>Otherwise, healthy/varied in general, low junk.&nbsp;</span><span>[Though I’m a sucker for free food, and cave whenever the opportunity arises.]</span></p><h3>Other</h3><p><span>Since a few people have wanted to nerd out about gear, I’ll jabber on about that in a separate post.</span></p><h3><span>Upcoming Agenda</span></h3><ul dir=\"ltr\"><li><span>Planning a couple multi-day bike trips in February. As of now, I'm dreaming up one up the coast, and one down the coast; hopefully I'll have time to do a few more before I leave California</span></li><li><span>Continuing cross-training&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Continuing bookings. I don't expect to have everything finalized by the time I head out on my trip, but I want to at least be past the filtering/reference-checking/cold-calling/figuring-out-who's-actually-serious phase. [Psst: Got a serious interest in hiring me? Contact me ASAP! We don't have to schedule or confirm anything right away, but I need to get you on my list.]</span></li><li><span><span>Looking into hosts and camping</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Buying the rest of the shit I need [I've got a little stack of REI vouchers for February, ka-ching!]</span></span></span></li></ul><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><span></span></p>\n</div>",

[/caption] \n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">The appeal of cycling, I mean.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">There's the obvious stuff that doesn't take&nbsp;<em>being</em>&nbsp;on a bike for long to work out: great exercise, not spending money on gas, reduced carbon footprint. Blah, blah, yes. That's not what I mean.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I mean the <em>real</em>&nbsp;appeal. What makes people go kind of crazy for it, and spend lots of money for it. Granted, I know there are a lot of different reasons people are drawn to the sport and my experience is not a universal one—but I've been discovering <em>my</em>&nbsp;reasons. And that the real magic of it is far more subtle.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">Since it's subtle, I'll try to illustrate what I mean, rather than tell you outright.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I tried riding to the&nbsp;climbing gym/yoga studio instead of driving for the first time about a week ago [I've now ridden there several times since].</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">In that one ride, I passed homeless shanty towns in jungles of concrete underbrush&nbsp;and chain link overgrowth, nestled just out of view of roads and train tracks.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I saw some true feats of resourcefulness. There were sophisticated little villas made of tarps and reclaimed mattresses, with a makeshift shower system, common hangout areas, little sculpture gardens made of found junk. One residence had a&nbsp;decadent entrance constructed of felled trees and planks of wood that made an imposing stair set and tunnel. I saw structures that the average white collar employee, if he hit hard enough luck, would never dream up, let alone realize. As I zipped under a bridge, a group of traveling dirtbags with bikes&nbsp;[what I'll be soon, in other words]&nbsp;whooped supportively and yelled, \"Get it, girl!\"</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I rode along a river [rampant with signs of a recent flood], through a park, passing one&nbsp;guy who was swaying to the sheet music he was reading, another guy baffled by his mountain of camping and cycling gear strewn over a picnic table,&nbsp;and an obese squirrel wrestling with an entire loaf of bread. I rode through an international airport, and behind a decadent hotel.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">Then I turned on a random road because a sign was posted in front of it with&nbsp;my first name and an arrow, and I'm a pretty avid follower of arbitrary circumstances and coincidences&nbsp;[i.e., when in doubt, flip a coin]. That&nbsp;road led me to a bike shop, where I had some very helpful&nbsp;conversations, and to a good cheap&nbsp;dinner spot.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">I got to the gym, having logged about seventeen relatively flat miles, warmed up and ready to keep moving.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"> </p><p>The alternative, in a car, is about twenty-minutes on congested suburban main roads.</p><p>[PS: I've logged 135 cycling miles, six&nbsp;hours of yoga, seven hours of climbing, and a wee bit of jogging in the last four days! And somehow managed to keep&nbsp;<em>mostly</em>&nbsp;on top of my emails, promotion, and errands. Mostly.&nbsp;I'm doing stuff, I swear!]</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n       [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1221\"]<img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1422775294875-T71RGN6E7FZ4HMSPM3K4/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\" Recent ride around a lake, which was teeming with turtles and birds, but conspicuously devoid of bipeds. \"/>  Recent ride around a lake, which was teeming with turtles and birds, but conspicuously devoid of bipeds.

I visited Southeast Asia for the first time, had an idyllic first modeling tour in Australia [and made it to all but two of the states and internal territories], spent six months getting splinters and busting my balls to make a seven-story-playhouse-sculpture and&nbsp;learning a lot of new skills [and a few rough life lessons] along the way, got work remodeling houses on the side, and other things.</span></p><p><span>The year before that, I published my first writing pieces, worked as a masseuse at an upscale spa, learned to fabricate gigantic fire cannons, and climbed into a sixty-five foot bamboo tower in nothing but a hard hat and climbing harness in order to adjust heavy fuel lines, did farm work for the first time, etc.</span></p><p><span>In times of inertia or fatigue or self-doubt,&nbsp;it's easy for me to feel discouraged, even envious, of my past self. Like I can't live up to my former energy or willingness to take risks. Like I'd rather just watch documentaries.</span></p><p><span>Which is it's in my best interest to suck it up and keep chugging&nbsp;onward and upward—so that, a month, a year, five years from now, I'll have to outdo myself again.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>So! Goals for this 2015:</span></p><p><span>1. Successfully complete my East Coast Model/Bike Tour [at the very least, “successfully” means I’ll see the trip to its end, and that my body, mind, and modeling reputation will all still be intact when I do—though, of course, I’m hoping for much more]</span></p><p><span>2. Expand my modeling network:</span></p><ul><li><span>Not counting my East Coast trip, tour at least three US cities I’ve never been to before.</span></li><li><span><span>Meet more badass traveling models.&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span><span><span>Be open to planning a future tour with another model—something I’ve always been simultaneously attracted and averse to. [Can’t force it, but I want to be receptive to it.]</span></span></span></li></ul><p><span>3. Improve my French throughout the year through daily practice [I've been good about this one so far]; move to northern France for the summer for a manor renovation project.</span></p><p><span>4. Debut modeling tour in Europe!</span></p><p><span>As for the winter and beyond…I’m not planning that far yet, but I’ve got several pipe dreams lined up that could all settle into the end of my year nicely if no other unforeseen opportunities arise:</span></p><p><span>Could do a Southern Tier road trip and model in the warmer states. Could go to Australia and New Zealand. Could teach another ski season. Could work a season in Antarctica. Could do my yoga teacher training. Could hide in South America or Southeast Asia. Could do a writing residency. Could join a yacht crew. Could very easily be enticed by something different from all of the above.&nbsp;Far too soon to know.&nbsp;</span></p><p>To wax universal, if I may:</p><p>You are not your past accomplishments:&nbsp;prior successes do not validate your laziness, complacency, or self-coddling today.&nbsp;You are not your past failures: do not continually punish yourself for having tried and failed, nor even for having done wrong, provided that you did what you could to set things right and have put the lessons of your mistake into practice.</p><p>UPDATE: Continuing to go on&nbsp;longer rides on harder terrain and cross-train around the Bay. Soon going on my first multi-day ride; stay tuned. 8]</p>\n</div>",

Once upon a time, there was no REI. People climbed in wooden clogs and protected themselves with lengths of rope. People bundled up however they could and threw their stuff&nbsp;into knapsacks; there were no space-age high-performance fabrics, no ergonomics specialty vendors.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Come to think of it, I see this all the time with photography, too, where some poor shmuck will feel like being a photographer means he has to buy $9,000 lenses that he has no idea how to use, or that he has to use six different soft boxes to light a model for one studio shoot. Contrarily, many of my favorite photographers use the most rudimentary, jerry-rigged, low-fi gear of all. It's all about the driver, not the car!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Of course, when it comes to the sports I have experience with, my approach is also \"adapt\" rather than \"prepare\".</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Like backpacking. I almost never bring a tent when I'm backpacking. I rely more on a map and compass than I do on having enough food. On my last solo backpacking trip, three weeks in Yosemite, I tested&nbsp;out my&nbsp;pair of Vibram five fingers because they were marketed for hiking—when they inflamed my tendons, I just hiked barefoot, no biggie.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">[In that vein, after much deliberation I've decided to go with my sleeping bag, a&nbsp;tarp, and&nbsp;a mosquito net. It's not enough to make things exceedingly comfortable...but it's enough that I'll be self-reliant if I can't find a host or one falls through, and won't weigh nearly as much as a tent.]</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But I have a lot of experience backpacking; it isn't daunting anymore.&nbsp;I lived in the backcountry non-stop for&nbsp;half a year when I was nineteen. Backpacking and hiking were&nbsp;my only modes of travel, leaving plenty of room for trial and error, and exploring my&nbsp;limitations.&nbsp;I've hiked fifteen miles on an empty stomach with a full pack at 10,000 feet above sea level. I've taken off-trail shortcuts.&nbsp;I can afford to take some&nbsp;risks and cut some corners because I can calculate what the risks&nbsp;<em>are.</em></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And even if you're not quite&nbsp;as much of a nut job as I am, if we're talking backpacking, skiing, or rock climbing, I could also easily tell you what \"must-haves\" really, really are not must-haves, suggest cheaper/lighter/better substitutes for specialty gear, and tell you which items you can get away with buying used or low-end. My partner's dad just scored a pair of $800 Rossignol skis from two years ago, including bindings, for $5 at a Savers. They look like they may have been used&nbsp;<em>once</em>; one&nbsp;wax and they were&nbsp;good to go. Cross my heart and hope to die.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Cycling, on the other hand? I'm clueless. I haven't had those years or even months of rigorous beta testing.&nbsp;What climbers call a gumby, what skiers and boarders call a gaper, what skaters call a poser, what photographers call a GWC. When I first decided I would go on this trip, all I knew how to do was&nbsp;get on my bike, pedal, brake. I am in a self-guided accelerated-learning course, not only in terms of physical conditioning, but also <em>studying</em>&nbsp;[ergonomics, necessary gear, bike components, DIY repairs...].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So, I've been doing that. But the demographic of experts doesn't really see&nbsp;me as part of their audience. Cycling, in&nbsp;particular, is a hobby that seems to attract people with lots of money and very little free time, but a predictable lifestyle that allows them to make long-term commitments.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><em>The Complete Guide to Long-Distance Cycling,&nbsp;</em>the book I'm currently reading, is a great example. I've learned a lot from this book, but it's also done a good job of using a doomsday, worst-case-scenario approach in order to convince me that I need to buy a million things [like several pairs of padded shorts, and leg warmers, and a million toiletries, and&nbsp;so on]&nbsp;in order to avoid an untimely end [or at least the ER]...and that I cannot possibly train effectively without a cycle computer, heart monitor, and stationary bike. If I were a middle-aged professional with a predictable annual schedule, consistent cash flow, and superfluous paranoia,&nbsp;I might take a lot more of&nbsp;that advice.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But that's not me. I'm a crazy quasi-hippie who burns bright and fast, but not always&nbsp;steady.&nbsp;Frugality is compulsory for me. And my life runs in fast, dense chunks, rather than a steady flow:&nbsp;I can more easily devote every waking moment of one month to intense learning and training than I can devote two days a week for several months.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So, I've sought out experienced cyclists at various bike shops, sporting goods stores, and REI, and barraged them with questions, hoping to find some who share my adaptation-oriented, minimalist sentiments.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My favorite so far has been an older guy who told me he tours&nbsp;in cargo pants and old tshirts and doesn't bother with special rain gear or gizmos,&nbsp;and doesn't like to wander around towns \"looking like a cyclist\". A&nbsp;man after my own heart.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I've been buying equipment in little batches as I've learned more about what I might need [or really, really want and have a good use for].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A few cool items and tips&nbsp;I've picked up:</p><ul data-rte-list=\"default\"><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Proud of this one: For cycling shoes, I'm using a pair of Scarpa rock climbing approach shoes on clearance&nbsp;[got a kudos from some cyclist employees at REI for that one]. Cheaper, and better, than those \"casual/street\" cycling shoes recommended for tours [since I want something that'll double as a street shoe]. These are low profile [to fit in cages], laces go&nbsp;all the way to the toes [for easy loosening if/when my feet swell after a long day of riding], the soles are stiffer than \"street\" cycling shoes&nbsp;but more walkable than super aggressive racing shoes. I re-laced them so that the bows are on the outsides of the shoe and less likely to get tangled up while I'm pedaling, even if they come untied. Plus, they'll&nbsp;be useful when I next go hiking or climbing. Score!</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Discovered that several items are cheaper at REI and sporting goods stores if you get them in a color that's being discontinued. I was going to pass on a sporty rain jacket/windbreaker and find another way to deal with the weather...till I learned that it'd be $35 less if I was just willing to get one in light purple.</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I've been offered sponsorship of a GPS/safety watch, so we'll see if that pans out! Will obviously be posting more about it, if so. 8]</p></li><li><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Skipped a lot of the bucket list things: the jerseys, the hydration pack, the solar charger, the route maps [which would be great...except they're $15 a pop and I'd need to buy about seven]. However, I did cave in and get one pair of padded bike shorts [considering the mileage of this trip, I think that is&nbsp;a totally reasonable luxury] and one of those little charge-storing doohickeys [which I might exchange for a generator that charges my electronics while I'm cycling...supposedly there's now one that's safe to use for a phone].</p></li></ul><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I've also got some very specific items with me in order to smoothly bridge the worlds of cycling and modeling [i.e., avoiding tan lines and blemishes, and having basic makeup/wardrobe without substantial bulk and&nbsp;weight], and feel I've managed to be pretty clever about some of my solutions—but I'll save that for another post.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Update: Tomorrow is my biggest test yet, where I show myself just what I'm cut out for [I hope].&nbsp;I'll be starting my first multi-day trip: about three hundred and fifty cycled miles in six days, largely moderate terrain but with a couple intimidating climbs. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My training over the last few weeks has seen me improving enormously, but I'm still pretty nervous. I'll have Alex with me, and will be carrying minimal gear, since this is going to be&nbsp;my first accurate taste of what touring is going to be like. Wish me luck! Will post photos and so on afterwards, of course. 8]</p>\n</div>",

I typically assume I'm not the first to have done anything...but I think it's safe to say I'm probably the first to plan a trip quite like this.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">While I have a propensity to dive right into things, I've put a lot of thought into this. I'm not completely naive: touring as a model and touring as a cyclist are, by default, pretty&nbsp;incompatible things. Each demands certain things that the other naturally complicates.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\">So, here are some problems, and the solutions I've slapped together&nbsp;[I'm sure I will discover more problems and come up with more solutions along the way].</p><p><strong>Problem #1</strong>: Tan lines. Tan lines. TAN LINES. Cannot be showing up to shoots with gnarly tan lines.</p><p>This is one I've&nbsp;mulled over for quite a while, and I believe I've finally gotten it handled:</p><ul><li>White pantyhose!&nbsp;I read about a pro cyclist who does this because he's prone to burning, and supposedly the white layer even kept him cooler during his rides. For my arms: white children's pantyhose with the feet cut off.</li><li>Obviously, sunscreen on all exposed areas. No-brainer.</li><li>Tan-through t-shirts [I didn't even know this was a thing until recently].</li><li>Scheduled,&nbsp;periodic jaunts along nude beaches [or in the private backyards of whichever of my&nbsp;hosts won't mind], particularly when first arriving in a new city where I've booked work. [I tan quickly and never burn,&nbsp;so in the past I've been able to eliminate tan lines in a day or so this way before my modeling trips.]</li><li>If needed/For touch-ups: slightly tinted/bronzing/shimmer lotions [i.e.,&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;fake tan]&nbsp;that will help refract light and make lines disappear without making me look orange [this will also help minimize any other marks or blemishes].</li><li>Worst-case scenario: I want to avoid tanning booths [I have never visited one in my life], but in a pinch, it'd be better than disappointing a client.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><span><strong>Problem #2</strong>: Modeling demands a certain amount of prerequisite girly-gear&nbsp;[makeup and wardrobe]; cycling demands that I pack light, and bring practical items.</span></p><p>Fortunately, I almost always model nude [and, when I am modeling with clothes on, it's often been provided for the shoot], I almost always have good skin and tend to pose completely bare-faced [except for shoots with an MUA]. However, for those occasional shoots where I am asked to do my own makeup or supply some clothing items, it's a mark of basic&nbsp;professionalism that I be able to deliver on these modest fronts.</p><p>Makeup:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Nixed the bulky packaging on items like bronzer/highlighter/shadows in favor of a couple little replacement units that are meant to be part&nbsp;of a palette once you've used up that color. They&nbsp;have&nbsp;<em>no</em>&nbsp;packaging except for a disposable plastic cover.</li><li>Sample size items [like lipstick and eyeliner]: Not only are these either free or very cheap, but they're tiny and can easily be replaced if I use them up [though that's unlikely; I go through makeup very slowly since I don't wear it during my daily life, nor at most of my shoots].</li><li>One worthy splurge: got a Lorac Pro Palette! Super versatile [enough colors for any basic eye look], and the case is almost paper-thin! High quality makeup, and a good value compared to competing products by other brands.</li></ul><p>Wardrobe:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>I can't reasonably pack heels or boots, but I'll be bringing some lingerie/underwear sets/swimwear. Smooshes down into nothing, and weighs nothing. If I have room, there are a couple of fun items I have in mind that I'd like to pack, too [diaphonous and ornate dresses/skirts, a crazy bodysuit...]. We'll see!</li><li>I've made sure that most of the clothes I'll be cycling in are photogenic enough to serve as&nbsp;casual wardrobe, too&nbsp;[basic T-shirts/tanks, sports bra, etc.], rather than bringing cycling-specific clothing that I can't model in.</li></ul><p><strong>Problem #3</strong>: Modeling requires regular Internet access and lots of online busy-work drudgery; cycling through remote areas sometimes precludes getting Internet.</p><ul><li>Well, this year I finally caved in and got a smartphone with a data plan [chose Verizon for optimal coverage in remote areas].&nbsp;</li><li>I also got one of those charge-storage devices, which I may or may not switch for a generator that charges my phone while I pedal.</li><li>I started promotion and booking <em>very</em>&nbsp;early<em> </em>for a change, to get a head start.&nbsp;Obviously I'll still be booking while I'm on my trip, since many clients can't commit months in advance—but I've gotten&nbsp;the time-consuming phases of cold calls and&nbsp;checking for genuine interest,&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;[compensation and content], good&nbsp;model&nbsp;references,&nbsp;and other eliminative busy-work&nbsp;out of the way. So, once I'm on the road, I will only have to manage a small number of genuinely interested possible clients, and can focus directly on scheduling with them [rather than broad-beam promotion], so if I go a couple days at a time without access to my email I won't fall far behind.</li></ul><p><strong>Problem #4</strong>: Showing up exhausted to shoots. Or missing a shoot due to unforeseen emergencies [bad weather, technical difficulties beyond the scope of what I'm equipped to prepare...though I've been pretty neurotic about making a well-stocked tool kit, it could still happen].&nbsp;I've been asked about this a lot. Cycling aside, I'm a professional. I need to show up fresh to my shoots, of course, and be able to make a 100% commitment that I&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;be there.</p><ul><li>The overall answer is simple:&nbsp;<span>I'm creating a&nbsp;</span><em>clear&nbsp;</em><span>buffer between my riding days and my shooting days, as well as between one shoot and the next, to account for tiredness and even unforeseen delays.&nbsp;</span></li><li>For starters, I'm not booking <em>nearly&nbsp;</em>as prolifically as on other modeling tours. In several cases, I'm only reserving space for one&nbsp;photo shoot in a given city, since the logistics of getting to every shoot will be complicated. <span>Usually I'm happy to do lots of 2-hour shoots, and to do traditional media sittings for artists,&nbsp;</span>but this time around I have to be very selective about what jobs I can reasonably accept, since I am relying on far fewer jobs to carry me financially, and each one really needs to count.&nbsp;One hard thing has been turning down many jobs that I would otherwise <em>love</em>&nbsp;to accept, simply because they would thin my schedule out too much.&nbsp;I could risk booking more work, but I need ample&nbsp;cushioning&nbsp;between my jobs to make up for lost time in the event that something delays me—I couldn't have gotten this far as a model, nor convinced people I was capable of pulling this trip off, if not for the trust I've established and consequent&nbsp;reputation I've built...one of my challenges on this trip will be making sure that I protect and honor that reputation.&nbsp;Fortunately, I have a lot of amazing clients who have offered to host/feed me in addition to hiring me, or who want to hire me&nbsp;for two half days or a full day—or even two full days!—which helps offset the fact that my availability is 5-10% what it would be if I were driving or flying. And I've also been surprised by the number of photographers who are also cycling enthusiasts and who've given me invaluable advice!&nbsp;Thanks to each of you who have been flexible, resourceful, supportive, and generous through the planning stages; I wouldn't be able to do this trip without you!</li><li>I've considered the mileage&nbsp;and other factors [elevation gains, potential for wind, the fact that I'm not super fast and will be carrying a lot of weight]&nbsp;of my&nbsp;<em>entire&nbsp;</em>route. Every day, every mile of it. Multiple times. And I've set myself conservative goals of when I expect myself to be in each next city destination—conservative enough that I'll&nbsp;still be able to make them without a problem if I were held back by a day, or even a couple days [i.e.,&nbsp;a <em>projected</em>&nbsp;mileage of <em>no more</em> than forty miles in a given day, although I could, and almost certainly will,&nbsp;technically ride quite a bit farther through most conditions].&nbsp;</li><li>Also, I am only shooting during overall rest periods/rest days.&nbsp;If we have a shoot booked, it means that I'm getting to your area&nbsp;<em>at least</em>&nbsp;the night&nbsp;before we're meant to shoot, with ample time&nbsp;to stretch, get cleaned up, and get a good night's sleep.&nbsp;During my shoot days, I will be reliant on public transit and&nbsp;carpooling, and will not be arriving to shoots on my bike [except in specific cases where photographers have&nbsp;<em>asked</em>&nbsp;me to ride/bring my bike because they want to incorporate it in the shoot—which is awesome, by the way]. I may be a bit bonkers for doing this trip, but I still value professionalism and integrity and have planned meticulously so that I show up to every job as a camera-ready model rather than a&nbsp;sweaty,&nbsp;depleted gremlin!&nbsp;</li></ul><p>So, those are some of the main conflicts I think I've resolved. We'll see what other challenges crop up that are unique to the wonky circumstances of my trip.</p><p style=\"margin-left:0px; margin-right:0px\"><span>Update: Had to push my trip back a bit due to fantastically unusual [for this area]&nbsp;weather...the South Bay Area tends to be a benign and virtually weather less place, but we've had such \"torrential\" rains that there's been flooding on the roads and trails and lots of road work.&nbsp;I was on the fence for a bit, since wind and rain will be inevitabilities on my actual trip, and I've been cooped up doing indoor exercise for the last several days. However, tomorrow's meant to be sunny and, fingers crossed, I should be good to ride the 60-ish miles from here to my friend's house on the peninsula! 8]</span></p>\n</div>",

[In other words, Happy Valentine's Day.]</p><p>Hey guys! So I finally went on my first overnight trip, as a way of dipping my toes a bit further&nbsp;into what the \"real\" trip is actually going to be like.</p><p><strong>Day 1<br />San Jose, CA</strong></p><p>As usual, Chaos/Serendipity/The Universe/The Force/what-have-you&nbsp;did a better job planning out my adventures than I ever could have.</p><p>Originally I was going to do a big loop up starting in the South Bay,&nbsp;up through the city, over to&nbsp;Sacramento, down through the East Bay. Largely the appeal of this particular route&nbsp;was to visit some good friends.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there was weather, which displaced my trip by two days...which was enough to foster schedule conflicts with all of the friends I intended to visit&nbsp;such that they'd be unable to hang out or in many cases even offer crash space. Mwop, mwop.</p><p>But I needed to get at least one practice trip in this month.</p><p>So, without much of a plan, Alex and I rode up to Pacifica to stay with <a href=\"http://www.elenazhukova.com\">Elena Zhukova</a>, a conceptual advertising photographer who's been photographing me since I was a modeling greenhorn&nbsp;and she was an art student in San Francisco [i.e., for a while], and her husband Aleksey.</p><p>Barely six miles into the ride, Alex's old tire was shredded, and so I ferociously guarded our bikes while he ran off to get a new tire and tube—a delay that bit an hour or two into our&nbsp;day. There was one stretch so unrelentingly&nbsp;steep that I wound up&nbsp;walking my bike&nbsp;for about a tenth of a mile <span>[cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater</span><span>]</span>.&nbsp;</p><p>When we got to the Pacifica, we decompressed for a while,<span>&nbsp;poking at bugs [we found a cluster of maggots outside] and&nbsp;battle droids</span><span>&nbsp;before being treated to an awesome home-cooked</span>&nbsp;dinner of fish and vegetables,&nbsp;and&nbsp;liberally supplied with beer, wine,&nbsp;and bourbon.</p><p>Conversation that evening was punctuated by the hum of the&nbsp;ocean and the crackling of the outdoor heater. I leaned on a pillow&nbsp;stuffed with $15,000 in shredded dollar bills. Eddy the&nbsp;dog leaned on me. It seemed like a first taste of what my trip might turn out to be like on its best days:&nbsp;long mornings of cycling through beautiful country, rewarded&nbsp;in the evenings&nbsp;good food and company and a delicious feeling of&nbsp;satisfaction&nbsp;that was a paradoxical&nbsp;hybrid of&nbsp;<span>\"having discovered&nbsp;somewhere new\"</span>&nbsp;and \"having made&nbsp;it back home\"<em>.&nbsp;</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423965027795-Q5L8V6C53J98LP1G98TK/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423964139908-Y2HVKDS4GNOOK0KN5U53/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423965321009-PQ54W7FU1Z54E6YKBGVH/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423964999662-QBZ7SH5W7KC98KIZFI77/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423964978206-SDQ7WC8BANNAOU5JDV5M/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423964920023-MWV6FSVH9G4GMNPDPZ1F/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p><strong><span>Day 2<br />Pacifica, CA</span></strong></p><p><span>Originally we'd planned to move along the next morning, but it turns out that Aleksey is an avid cyclist, so he offered to take us on a ride the following day around Pacifica and Half Moon Bay!</span></p><p>In one stunning loop, I rode behind Alex and Alex [there are so many Alexes]&nbsp;as we&nbsp;climbed through steep eucalyptus forests, down along Devil's Slide [stopping to explore old military bunkers en route], past surfers on the beach, past helicopters taking off and landing on an airstrip in fields of wildflowers, past the smells of fish and chips and waffles and seaweed,&nbsp;past upscale marinas, through a surreal mountain tunnel, and I had a harrowing first off-road excursion along the edges of sea cliffs.

Hills are one thing, rattlesnakes are one thing, weather is one thing...but cars. Drivers. Those&nbsp;freak me the fuck out. Because, no matter how defensively I ride, no matter how many bright yellow or blinky&nbsp;or reflective things I stick onto myself or my bike, I have no ultimate say in whether the drivers coming up on me are paying attention, or of sound mind, or sober, or whatever. Aggressive, reactive, impatient drivers are all too common. So are absent-minded, text-messaging, daydreaming drivers. And drunk drivers, or sleepy drivers. And drivers zipping around tight corners at 90 MPH.&nbsp;You get the picture. Besides avoiding situations where I'm likely to be hit in the first place, there's really only so much I can do once I'm on the road.</p><p>Existentially jarred after almost getting booty-bumped by two semi-trucks in a row, Alex and I pulled off and sat in a patch of grass next to a kitschy old sign that said&nbsp;<em>Santa's Tree Farm</em>, the only distinguishable&nbsp;landmark in sight, debating whether we&nbsp;ought to chug on through and hope for the best, or wait for traffic to die down or, I don't know, hitchhike. After our heart rates settled down we decided to mosey on through, walking our bikes through a few particularly bad stretches.</p><p>Lesson learned: be more attentive to traffic patterns and look at my&nbsp;<em>entire</em>&nbsp;route before proceeding, particularly if it's going to be on a highway [before setting off, we'd&nbsp;scanned Google Earth very briefly, seen that a chunk of the 92 had a nice shoulder and four lanes, and called it good]. <em>Hurp dap.</em></p><p>By the time we got to Redwood City, we were a bit exhausted for the opera [even at $10 a pop, it's not all that worthwhile going to a show if you sleep through the whole thing]. Fortunately our buddy Carlos was in town, and facilitated our recalibration to life&nbsp;with Mexican food, card games, and a gift of rum he'd infused with vanilla beans, before we headed off to visit my parents in order to spend the weekend going on bike rides&nbsp;with my dad&nbsp;[whom I'm<em> just</em> now beginning to keep up with].</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423964681310-HVWT3JJPLGCYQEQN0BGC/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423965053860-NHCYBPXT2TG7I8P18CKY/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423965076140-VXA6OUNM8XQXQ9LXJROG/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423965151701-6JT43NT8IZ02OLNX1CXN/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423965122506-78WRLT7EW4702F7NZ0RP/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1423964659977-3YBW7YTJ7BOMLJC6I396/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p>Final tally for this trip?<br /><br />104 miles ridden<br />6,167&nbsp;feet climbed</p><p>Not too shabby for someone who got her ass kicked by a few-hundred-feet climb&nbsp;on a twelve-mile loop just over a month ago!</p><p>My improvements have been noticeable on a day-to-day basis, and as time goes on it becomes easier [more exciting, less daunting] for me to motivate myself to push that little bit harder.&nbsp;Thankfully, the beginning of my trip won't involve so much climbing [since my whole route through Florida and Georgia will be pretty much flat].</p><p>Two weeks left until my flight, and I've&nbsp;still got so much to figure out!</p><p>Tomorrow?

The cheapest bike bags I could find were several hundred dollars a pop [closer to a thousand for a hard case]...and then I'd either have a big bike bag with me for my whole trip, or would have to deal with&nbsp;shipping&nbsp;it somewhere or giving&nbsp;it away. And, as it stands, I'm already going to have to pay a minimum of $150 to fly with it.&nbsp;I'm hoping TLC and bubble wrap&nbsp;will be serviceable substitutes for waterproof casing, bang-proof casing.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My other baggage [i.e., everything I'll be lugging around on my bike every day] clocks in at about 40 pounds. Hm.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This is the part where I wax sentimental and thank everyone.&nbsp;You know, in case my plane crashes on its way to Key West and this whole year of planning turns out to be some ludicrous&nbsp;anticlimax.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">...Or something.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So get your barf bags ready!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Firstly, thanks go to everyone&nbsp;whom I could probably call \"fans\" [those who've&nbsp;been following my progress and supporting my journey whom I know neither personally nor professionally]&nbsp;even though using that word&nbsp;feels horribly pretentious and dismissive and straight-up deluded.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you to those who've helped sponsor&nbsp;this&nbsp;trip. I wasn't sure how to feel when I first put up that sidebar: a few people had emailed me, asking me for an easy way to contribute to my trip, which surprised me. So I offered the option, but with a sort of uneasy, ambivalent trepidation and what I like to call \"first world guilt\" [guilt is rarely, if ever, a productive feeling...but can be a tempting one nonetheless]. I mean, yes,&nbsp;I'm financially independent [and generally financially responsible]—but I'm also someone who has the privilege to customize my life according to my values, my whims, my passions. And yes, I do realize that some of that \"privilege\" has actually been created by&nbsp;my actions and choices&nbsp;[I have plenty of friends who are perfectly capable, with relative freedom in their lives, most of&nbsp;whom have considerably more in their bank accounts than I do in mine, telling me that they wish they could do what I do...and really, the only thing stopping them is themselves]—but it's undeniable that the other chunk&nbsp;of that privilege really is due to the circumstances and opportunity of my birth and immediate surroundings. I am of able body and sound mind [well, more or less], my genetics allow me to make a career out of my image, and I grew up in a first-world country without insurmountable obstacles between me and my dreams. None of that was&nbsp;a result of my choices or virtue...that part was just luck.&nbsp;Yes, I've worked hard to build the life I have—but for some, it doesn't matter how hard they work, external circumstances will still block their path.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway! As a thank you,&nbsp;I've got plenty of&nbsp;handmade cards protected in their own little waterproof freezer bag fortress stashed in my panniers that I will fill out and send intermittently on my trip. I've also got some extras, in case anyone else wants to jump aboard and contribute while my trip is in progress! Should be fun!&nbsp;You won't know when yours is&nbsp;coming [hint: sometime between March and July]! I've spent a lot of time on them, so I hope you'll all be stoked! Exclamation points! Whoo!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Also, thank you, thank you&nbsp;to those of you who've sent encouraging emails [not the dick pics, though—you guys can keep those to yourselves, eck]. A&nbsp;few months ago I was wondering whether this was even a trip worth documenting online, this trip that is ultimately about my own journey. Me:&nbsp;cycling, pushing myself,&nbsp;getting in shape. Me:&nbsp;trying something new and&nbsp;hopefully having fun and being challenged and learning shit and, you know, \"finding myself\" in the middle of nowhere and all that jazz. Me:&nbsp;modeling in big cities. Regardless of what I choose to do afterwards with my time or money, this trip in and of itself is an individualist pursuit.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I didn't know if my trip would feel relevant to anyone else...so receiving encouraging words and contributions from&nbsp;people who've found me inspiring or relatable [or totally&nbsp;alien], or from people who've wanted to share things with me that they think I'd benefit from&nbsp;[cycling resources, inspirational videos, photographer suggestions, places to visit on my way, book recommendations...]&nbsp;has meant a lot.&nbsp;In the context of this one-woman adventure, it almost gives me&nbsp;this&nbsp;sense of anonymous solidarity.&nbsp;Anyway, while I'm a capricious correspondent [especially on the road],&nbsp;I'd like to keep this trip as interactive as possible by taking people up on those recommendations as much as I can, and reporting back here, so don't be shy!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Also, while many of you found me through my modeling work, which is what I would've expected,&nbsp;some of you found me through my articles from back in 2013,&nbsp;which I find especially flattering in this age of throwaway click-bait web articles that you share on Facebook and then promptly forget. I've admittedly put writing on the back burner [I don't count keeping this blog as \"writing\"] and&nbsp;hadn't submitted anything for publication&nbsp;<em>since&nbsp;</em>2013...and am starting to think that I am really out of excuses for not having done so [\"Wah, I don't have time right now to write something good, so why bother at all?\"] so as an exercise in telling perfectionism and procrastination to shove off, I&nbsp;submitted a little ditty today. Fingers crossed!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">TLDR: Really, I'm damn tickled that people have been inspired enough by my stumblings through life to freely invest even a modicum of their&nbsp;attention, good vibes, and money,&nbsp;towards supporting&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Enough on that. That brings me to the second \"thank you\": to&nbsp;those photographers who've hired me on this trip.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I know hiring me on a trip like this requires an extra leap of faith, particularly since many of you have not worked with me before. This is not a normal modeling tour. This trip has been very polarizing to photographers: they either think it's the coolest thing ever and feel even more inclined to hire me than they otherwise would...or they think my going on a bike trip is a frivolous and unprofessional impediment to my performing aptly as a model.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">To those in the former group, thank you&nbsp;for respecting both my profession and my spirit, and trusting in my reputation.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n       [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1000\"]<img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425174321955-XB5W9065HH9S08C94EDX/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\" It's taken most of my life to grow into those cheeks \"/>  It's taken most of my life to grow into those cheeks [/caption] \n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And, finally, getting a bit more personal.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks go to my dad, for helping to push me during this last training period, sharing his knowledge and taking me on weekend training rides that kicked my ass. He was, and as of now probably still&nbsp;is, a better cyclist than I am. Rewinding:&nbsp;I've always been a difficult kid, and it took a while for my parents to realize I ultimately functioned better with a <em>laissez-faire</em> approach. That I will figure things out, even if I insist upon doing so the hard way. My parents did not spoil me, even when they&nbsp;could have, and I was working my first job [shoveling horse shit in Utah] by fourteen. Of course, I hated that at the time, but looking at how helpless a lot of my former classmates now&nbsp;seem to feel, adrift in their lives and bogged down in school loans [and, in some cases, incapable of doing things as simple as booking their own flight itineraries or buying groceries]...I'm very grateful to have been raised a bit differently.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n       [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"640\"]<img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425174765392-IU4WIW9K25TF5L7EX9SN/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\" A friend of mine discovered this photo on Lightning in a Bottle 2013's promotional page.&nbsp;some random stranger had taken it without our knowledge,&nbsp;which makes me like it all the more. \"/>  A friend of mine discovered this photo on Lightning in a Bottle 2013's promotional page.&nbsp;some random stranger had taken it without our knowledge,&nbsp;which makes me like it all the more.

He is a rare breed for many reasons, but for starters, he&nbsp;has never&nbsp;demonstrated entitlement or&nbsp;possessiveness towards me, gives me ample space when I need it [whether I want it or not], and&nbsp;is never afraid to be&nbsp;completely accessible and vulnerable. Not a common set of virtues to find in the same person. Plus, he sets a good example: he loves everyone with an open hand; he&nbsp;sets his own standards for himself and doesn't dwell on judging the virtue [or lack thereof] in others and&nbsp;is an eternal child: infinitely goofy&nbsp;and infinitely wise, and very good at laughing at himself. My life has been infinitely better since we haphazardly&nbsp;collided out in the desert in 2012.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">...Oh, yeah. And also,&nbsp;he knows a shit ton about bikes, makes good food, and makes me laugh.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And, as fate would have it, my other favorite man&nbsp;[not one of the aforementioned two]&nbsp;is flying to Taiwan out of the same airport, around the same time, so we'll be able to get up to some shenanigans before my red-eye. So I've got lots of lovey-dovey in my day, hence the nausea.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">All right.

At several points I was pretty much convinced it wasn’t going to happen.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Against a backdrop of rain and lightning uncharacteristic in the Bay, I said my goodbyes to Alex and Nathan who were both there to see me off.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Then there were other trifling&nbsp;incidents on my way to the gate: I must have grabbed my expired license instead of my current one on my way out the door [d'oh] and the TSA guys were convinced that there was something in my left pocket [there wasn't—nor was I happy to see them]. Two hours after arriving, I got through security checkpoint, somewhat frazzled.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My flight was delayed, which was fine by me. I dragged myself into the nearest airport bar and wound up ruthlessly bantering with an exceptionally handsome lawyer [he looked strikingly like a young Hemingway] who was sporting a black eye.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">About three hours of sleep later [couldn’t get back to sleep after my layover in Atlanta] and I was spat out of Key West airport, blinking wearily at the sun.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Since then I've repeatedly been punk'd by serendipity and boggled at others' generosity. Must be Silver Lining Syndrome or something. Or the Universe is trying to teach me that I shouldn't bother trying to plan anything, ever.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Exhibit A: Every single one of my several hosting options had fallen through or gone MIA at the last minute. My arrival coincided with&nbsp;spring break, so finding a hotel or even campsite at such a late stage&nbsp;would not only be expensive, but possibly quite difficult. And I had a giant box with a disassembled bike, and all my gear, and nowhere to put them or reassemble them. I didn't really know what I was going to do [hide myself and all my crap behind a bush for the night?], but shit felt dire.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Silver lining: A friend I made during my brief stop in Shanghai last year got in touch out of the blue, and it came up that he had US hotel points that he couldn't use and that were about to expire. So I wound up with a free night at a deluxe king suite at the Hyatt,&nbsp;with a balcony drooping right over the shoreline; below me were beached humans flopping on the sand in front of a musician with comically poor taste in covers. I looked at them and&nbsp;thought:&nbsp;<em>If I knew anyone here, I could easily host a fifteen-or-so people shindig and still have wiggle room. What a crazy amount of space and luxury to waste on one person.</em></p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425373023843-0WAKNBMXZ9YYEZRHPYUD/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425373165135-IGA1ZVKEMN8JZR4HHZ61/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425373047284-8FOPCT9LJ24CCUAEADVT/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I got on with it. Little toy cars and fake choochoo trains and pedicabs rolled by as I quaffed black coffee in a cafe patio done up in bamboo and rope, digesting a lobster and shrimp omelette, and I felt compelled by the weather—76&nbsp;and all undiluted sunshine—to change into&nbsp;something froofroo and skimpy.&nbsp;I wandered to the Hemingway house [which was lovely and frothing&nbsp;with cats, many of which were polydactyls].</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425373441690-CBZ1IUU81H4Z2DIM5T85/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425373272480-5Y2I3QG1CKY8WKLPH5U1/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Then I holed up in my room to try and figure out my bike situation, so I would be mobile and unencumbered the following day.

I didn't know what I was going to do...ask the guys up front if they could hold onto my giant box and see if I could bribe a bike mechanic to help me bring it to a shop? If there was a shop. Everything I looked up was geared towards cruiser rentals for tourists. But I knew I was done making decisions for a while. I resigned myself to exploring the alleged Key West party scene, though I wasn't feeling very chipper by that point. I wandered Duval Street aimlessly [it struck me as a beachy cousin&nbsp;of NoLa’s Bourbon Street]. I failed to locate oysters before succumbing to hunger and eating conch.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Silver lining: wound up hanging out <em>all</em> damn night with wonderful, fun people. Chilly and Kerry, a&nbsp;local couple who work for a cycle touring company and have gone on a few tours, and Kai,&nbsp;freshly-graduated from high school and four months into his first tour circling around the country from Oregon...</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">...Moreover, Chilly just opened up a shop in Key West and came by my room the next morning to cash in my feeble promise of coffee, to use his mechanical sorcery to get my bike&nbsp;completely set up, and to teach me a few things [and conjure up a&nbsp;better front rack]. So, basically, he's a life saver. And quite innovative. Will update with his link if/when I get one.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Plus, in a few short hours, I miraculously found&nbsp;people to stick in my gifted-super-fancy-room-for-one-night so I could make better use of the space before giving it up. And to cover in the miles of bubble wrap strewn all over the floor from my bike box, so I could make better use of it before disposing of it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The one negative takeaway from last night was that, at 4 or 5am, quite drunk, I thought ordering myself room service breakfast for the next morning would be a brilliant idea. I'd never ordered room service before, it had occurred to me. First time for everything! Breakfast in bed!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Mediocre gravlox, mediocre coffee, good-but-very-very-very-small portion of grapefruit juice.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I learned a valuable lesson this morning...and that lesson cost me $40.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Exhibit C: Rode to prospective host's house today. Door had accidentally been locked by a roommate, I could not reach anyone by phone and the house was empty [and my would-be host was working until late, but I didn't know where she worked]. There was Kerry and Chilly's house where I'd just come from, but I'd locked it on my way out and they'd be gone for several hours.&nbsp;I really, <em>really</em>&nbsp;wanted a nap.&nbsp;With nowhere to go, a loaded bike, and no energy, I&nbsp;went and got a key lime pie [well...duh] and Internet for the time being, thinking perhaps I could just slump,&nbsp;unconscious, onto&nbsp;a table in a cafe, and maybe no one would mind.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Silver lining: Wound up being treated to dinner by David, an exceedingly candid, hilarious, fantastic man whom Nathan calls his \"fairy godfather\"&nbsp;whom I'd&nbsp;been advised to meet but hadn't heard from and had given up on meeting. He called, and&nbsp;I was neither&nbsp;asleep on a couch [the original plan], nor with other people, so with what may perhaps have been a bit of initial trepidation on his end, he offered to come get me and feed me. And it was a fit of fantastic&nbsp;conversation and, on my end, copious chuckling.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And now I am set up with with an air mattress thanks to Chilly and Kerry, so all is well!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">See what I mean? Some cosmic force&nbsp;disapproves of my attempts to make plans, apparently. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I&nbsp;<em>had</em>&nbsp;been planning to leave Key West tomorrow...but I can afford one more day. It deserves another day. Plus, I still haven't given myself a proper opportunity to sleep since getting to Florida [speaking of which...I should get on that right about&nbsp;now].&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Extrapolating on the last few days, but people can be so damn kind, and so immediately authentic. Sure, being smart and funny and charming are also virtues I admire. But really, kindness and candor are so underrated and, in the long run, probably matter a lot more.</p>\n</div>",

Knees&nbsp;sore. Right side burning [my arm protector—white little-girl stockings with the feet cut off—kept sliding down off my shoulder; as a result I now have a&nbsp;Disney-Pocahontas-esque armband tan]. Iguanas, iguanas everywhere, by the hundreds, some the size of dogs [invasive,&nbsp;I've been told].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Made my way, needle-and-thread-style, from island to island, along narrow bridges and roads overtaken on either side by turquoise ocean. I looked at other islands drifting solo in the ocean as I cranked my creaking legs to get me past them, unconnected by roads or bridges, and experienced a feeling that they were looking back at me, and offering their silent regard, like a stranger you lock eyes with momentarily from across a train platform, with a fleeting moment of mutuality.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Stopped for lunch and was swooped in on by strangers from all angles wanting to know what I was doing on my bike...wanting to know what my cause was [wanting to lecture me about how I needed a cause, and about what my cause&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be], wanting to know why I was going alone, wanting to know how old I was and who my parents were and so on. Wanting to know if I was aware that \"little girls\" get raped and run over by cars. Wanting to know if I was aware of the bike accident statistics in Florida [I was painfully aware, because there was another \"Drive Safely\" memorial&nbsp;commemorating fallen cyclists about once every tenth of a mile]. Wanting to know if I had a gun; wanting to convince me that I needed to get one if I had any brains.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Some wonderful, merciful&nbsp;people were also intrigued, but more understanding of my exhaustion, and made the nice gesture of simply offering their business cards and telling me to get in touch if I needed a host in their home state.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">All of this made it rather hard to decompress and eat after thirty sunny miles.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Ended the day with a harrowing, never-ending push across the seven-mile bridge as it began to grow dark. I imagined being run into by a drunk kid in a truck, pitched over the edge [it was Spring Break, after all], floating in the ocean, in the dark, unnoticed, miles from shore. And so on. In short, it was pretty fucking scary, and I almost peed myself in relief when I finally saw the twinkling lights of another island up&nbsp;ahead.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Wound up spending the night at an RV park in Knight's Key [the staff were really sweet and inquisitive,&nbsp;and threw some perks my way], sitting in a lawn chair and shooting the shit with Tom, a retired elementary school music teacher from the midwest, and Dale, a kooky ex-army truck driver who showed me some neat tricks for lighting matches.

They rescue sea turtles [ravaged primarily by litter, of all things, but also by general ocean pollution and boat accidents] and rehabilitate/release as many as they can back into the wild; a few&nbsp;turtles are injured to the point of being unable to survive in the wild and stay on as permanent residents. What an adorable, awesome place [got to peek in on a turtle surgery—removing tumors from a green sea turtle due to a virus that has been spreading in their species that attacks their eyes—during which an assistant was manning a ventilator, because turtles are conscious breathers, unlike us...they have to think about breathing in order to keep doing it, so they never \"sleep\" quite the way we do; their sleep consists of holding their breath for an extended period].&nbsp;I learned so damn much about turtles [random fun fact: a turtle egg's position in its nest determines its sex...eggs laid first, in the cooler bottom part of the nest, develop as males, whereas eggs laid last, in the warmer top part of the nest, develop as female; the interesting thing is that most reptiles' sexes are&nbsp;determined with their eggs in the opposite way]. Anyway. I could go on and on. [Did you know leatherbacks can dive several thousand feet, deeper than whales, and that their shells are completely soft?...God, I need to stop].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Took a lunch break in Islamorada, which is where the stress [compounded by the fatigue from a long ride in the sun] came in.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It began when I walked into a bathroom and saw my face for the first time in two days. Oh, boy.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now, if I were traveling purely for pleasure, I wouldn't give a damn how I looked. For realskies. The last time I went backpacking by myself, my entire face peeled off in what was nearly a face-wide second-degree pus-tastic sunburn [I was at 10,000 feet above sea level, see...], and I hadn't been fussed about that.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But the fact is, this is not just a cycling trip, but also a&nbsp;modeling trip. A trip I couldn't&nbsp;<em>afford </em>to do in the first place unless I were modeling along the way, anyhow [even with the savings I'd scrounged up for it for a year...since I spent six months last year volunteering full-time, my annual earnings had been laughably&nbsp;close to zilch].&nbsp;My reflection stared back at me: red, blotchy, burnt,&nbsp;swollen, and with&nbsp;<em>severely&nbsp;</em>sunburnt eyes. Like a Darth Maul shade of red...</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Would definitely have to nullify all that before arriving in Miami [where shooting would begin]. Didn't know if that was possible. Began to think that this whole trip, this idea of combining these two disparate things, had been some wildly conceited, ignorant&nbsp;mistake on my part. Hubris.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">...And also&nbsp;realized&nbsp;my prospects for lodging that night were slim. I didn't know any models or photographers around Key Largo or Islamorada. Couchsurfing and Warmshowers had yielded nothing. Campsites were all booked full [and I could've showed up and asked some campers to share their space, except the main campsites were all either south—the wrong direction—or too far north to make it before nighttime]. Hotels were all not only exorbitantly expensive, but booked full. Spring Break, you know.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Whoops. Well.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I wound up getting a lead to call Florida Bay Outfitters, an outdoor store, since their staff might be in the know about last-ditch stealth-camping options. A really nice guy on the phone gave me directions to a quarry where I could post up.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Of course, I get to the quarry, and am immediately ravaged by biting fleas and biting ants. Well...not the worst thing. It grows dark. My imagination goes berserk.&nbsp;I become a bit paranoid about the dark standing body of water I'd have to camp right by [since I've been told there are crocodiles and alligators in freshwater bodies in the Keys...granted, attacks are *aaaaalmost* unheard of, I'd been assured]. I have no tent. I think, a chilly iguana might cozy up to me at night to get warm—and while they're generally docile, I wouldn't want to be at the receiving end of the claws or tail-whip of a startled iguana that I might awaken in the morning. Etc. Etc.&nbsp;Every noise sounds like someone, or something, coming at me. If only I had a tent, I wouldn't feel so exposed [but I so rarely camp with a tent, honestly...then again, I've never camped before buggy standing water in Florida before].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I try to settle in, fleas notwithstanding. I flip a coin, and it tells me to get moving.&nbsp;I resolve to go on a walk, under the full moon, to explore the place and quell my nerves, and run&nbsp;into a man&nbsp;leaned against a rock. I call out to him and shine my light at him. No response. I walk right up to him and he's cool, cool, cool. Placid as the black water. He tells me he was on Lance Armstrong's team for seven years. He tells me he's ridden all over the country on a WalMart bike. He tells me I can put my food&nbsp;in his tent to keep it safe from raccoons. He tells me I can sleep in it, he’s not even going to use it, he’s just going to keep leaning on this rock.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">...He was possibly fine, honestly, maybe, maybe not, a nice, maybe slightly eccentric old man. But it was too dark to even see his face, and in my frazzled state I erred on the side of paranoia...and I shuffled off. I tried to flip a coin again and, I shit you not, the coin disappeared when it fell to the ground. I searched for five minutes with my headlamp before I realized how absurd it was to be devoting five minutes to finding a&nbsp;<em>penny</em>&nbsp;when I hadn't established camp somewhere.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So I left the quarry. I came upon a church and a children's center, complete with creepy moonlit playground [the slide was a giant yellow fish that swallowed children up as they slid down it]...with a hammock concealed in the backyard. Perfect.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I posted up there, woke myself back up at 4:30am the next morning after a couple restless hours of sleep [a wind chime by the children's center sounded suspiciously like the whipping of&nbsp;a heavy chain...] and continued on in the dark, stopping to rest only once the sun had come back up and my primal imagination could retire for the time being.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425870513545-TE5JRXRHDNYHWS7ME6IE/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425870453690-K2XS2FRUJJIH05WXPO31/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425870533477-DTTT7FUSGEEU02PZ76M5/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425870559025-98GP0OT875T6V6T2PCUI/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425870422123-Z036OFXOXH2UD2WV30AV/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Day 6: Key Largo to Everglades Hostel in Florida City</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Woke up, scuttled through the dark to the one&nbsp;Starbucks I'd seen or heard of on the Keys [the only place in Key Largo open at 6am, as far as I could tell]. Charged my electronics. Felt delirious, off almost no sleep and a couple days of heavy sun-blasted riding against headwinds. Was probed at by curious fellow patrons [one of whom bordered on invasive]&nbsp;whom I didn't have the heart to inform I was far too tired to make small talk with just then. More refrains of, \"You should have a man with you, you should have a gun, why don't you go do something more sensible, don't tell me you were biking just&nbsp;<em>now</em>&nbsp;in the dark, that's so stupid, now see here young lady, I am a stranger but I know what's best for you,&nbsp;etc., etc.,&nbsp;etc.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">[Don't get me wrong, most of the strangers I met have been exceedingly kind, encouraging, and even wildly generous...but that morning, and it was barely morning, still dark, after such a frazzled and anxious preceding night, the criticisms I was receiving from strangers were winding&nbsp;me up&nbsp;in a much more prominent way, and I was too exhausted to engage them, or even to disagree].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I continued on when the sun was up and passed out under a tree for an hour&nbsp;[photo at top of post].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Headed to the outdoor store that had tipped me off about the quarry the night before. I owed them one, and I needed some supplies anyway [least of all sunglasses...needed my eyes to&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;be sunburnt anymore]. The&nbsp;girl at the register wound up giving me a discount out of pure goodwill, and the guy on the floor had an extra tent in his car that he just&nbsp;<em>gave</em>&nbsp;me for free.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Then, ten miles out from Homestead, an SUV pulled over in front of me, and Maru, a woman who'd been working at Ma's Fish Camp yesterday [where I'd been hemming and hawing and trying-not-to-freak-out over having no clue where I could stay, or even where I could sneaky-stay], jumped out of the car and yelled my name.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">\"...Whoa, hi!\"<br><br>\"I was&nbsp;<em>thinking</em>&nbsp;of you this morning. See, I was tired. And then I thought, well, why am&nbsp;<em>I</em>&nbsp;tired when&nbsp;<em>you're&nbsp;</em>biking to&nbsp;<em>Maine</em>. And then I thought about you biking to Maine...and that made me&nbsp;<em>more</em>&nbsp;tired.\"</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">She wound up giving me her number and making a tentative offer of dinner-or-something.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I carried on, in considerably better spirits, feeling like the Universe was giving me kudos after having tested all my anxieties&nbsp;the previous night&nbsp;[though, of course, I'm somewhat inclined to believe that we live in an absurd Universe rather than an organized one, but hey, what the hell do I know...].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Everglades Hostel is the shit.

A photographer can be anyone from a straight-up professional photographer [and, even then, they might make a living as a fashion photographer, a stock photographer, a wedding photographer, a glamour nude photographer, or shooting senior portraits...] to an art student [and then, that might be a young precocious art student, or it might be someone who's recently immigrated or left a more conventional career with dreams of being an artist], and retired hobbyists from all manner of professions and backgrounds.&nbsp;</p><p>The interaction is ephemeral, and sort of \"outside\" of society [particularly during a nude shoot, which is an rather unconventional way to first meet someone], so oftentimes conversation quickly transcends stifled small talk. On drives to shoot locations, or while changing lights, or while taking breaks to re-up on coffee or Calories or change outfits, talk gets real, quickly, between people who might never cross paths otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>Modeling ensures me a life richly furnished with other people's stories: hilarious, tragic, intimate, extraordinary, and taboo. Survival stories, existential woes, forgotten dreams,&nbsp;marriage gripes. I've left shoots with new books on everything from quantum physics to the history of skepticism. I've left them with beadwork from Panama and cigars from the Dominican Republic and homemade wine and contacts for seasonal jobs in Antarctica. And my shoots often involve being privy to the unique perks of different people's lives and jobs: I've gotten to drive heavy machinery, smash a car,&nbsp;and wield oxyacetylene torches; I've gotten to hang out in eye-bogglingly fancy high-security establishments, pretending to be similarly pristine and decadent...but keenly aware of how long ago I last washed my hair in reality; I've gotten to crawl through secret tunnels and storage vaults in giant museums and take a bird's-eye peek down at dinosaur skeletons from above; I've been immersed in an intentional living community in the mountains,&nbsp;where I was dressed up as Disney princesses. All because of modeling.</p><p>It's an aspect to being a freelance traveling model that's rarely discussed but, for me,&nbsp;randomness and anthropological interest are key highlights of this job. Learning about different lives.</p><p>On my last day in Miami, Henry took me <a href=\"http://www.jwakefieldbrewing.com/\">J. Wakefield Brew</a><a href=\"http://www.jwakefieldbrewing.com/\">ing</a>, which just opened up in Wynwood. Fanfuckingtastic beer!&nbsp;Went home for my shoot with David [and we let Henry photograph me, too; he scuba dives and does awesome underwater photography but this was his first time photographing a nude model], who then took me out to dinner, gave me a parting gift of a few small bottles of scotch,&nbsp;and passed me off to his awesome partner Sarah who is now hosting me in Plantation. Today Sarah's been at work and I've had a mellow solitary day in of reading [<em>Opening Up: A Guide to Creating and Sustaining Open Relationships</em>&nbsp;by Tristan Taormino], catching up on emails, and hanging out in her pool.</p><p>I've been so well cared for by good people on this entire trip, and these last few days in particular have been so easygoing...I'm quite spoiled.&nbsp;Where'd all the brutal, validating struggle and turmoil I'm supposed to be undergoing disappear to? 8P</p><p>Anyway, these few days of modeling and relaxing have been a good little holiday from sweating and pedaling and sleeping-behind-random-buildings, but the riding will be resuming pretty soon and my next cluster of gigs aren't till Jacksonville!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425940159194-G20AMUUHYM9Y0NSPPUOI/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425940131516-8QJICIR8OEYOHCAIB2PX/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425940188517-BDWWE58R3Q2QEAT7O8PW/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1425940110984-8ID0VC3H3TAUOXDNCSBN/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426119383626-9G230L6EGF433NXY91EX/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426119359115-6BWJYC0CMISDYNR23DYK/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426120797151-UJX577TK6J2SDMCOGR68/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426119372061-KZD3AKP0271XMQV51VGA/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426120811650-MF3D9AJ5TA7L200MVTVR/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>",

Not that I don't stress out about finances&nbsp;like the next model, but when life gives me&nbsp;a cluster of cancellations all together...I tend to take it as a sign to go on shenaniganery leave and play. Especially if I'm traveling through beautiful places full of beautiful people. Yadda yadda.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So, I've been living and laughing and getting up to shenanigans and have generally felt very lovey-dovey and&nbsp;blissed-out and almost uncomfortably lucky,&nbsp;like the karmic&nbsp;Daddy's Girl trustafarian of a benevolent universe. Admittedly I've got a bit of cosmic-privilege guilt.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Now I'm back in bumptious-Internet-diplomat-slash-froofroo-camera-tart mode, though, with renewed gumption! Granted, that gumption's&nbsp;being counteracted&nbsp;by lots of fatigue.&nbsp;Just arrived in the endless sprawl that is Jacksonville [the largest contiguous city, by area, in the US]. Now I'm back on the shoots-all-the-time train for a little bit; I've got makeup on for the first time this year.&nbsp;Excited to be&nbsp;working for the first time with a lot of clients who, at the very least, seem like they're going to be awesome. So my next post is probably going to be just as directly-related-to-modeling as&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;post is decidedly-not-related-to-modeling-whatsoever.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As with all life's best times, there's only so deeply I'm inclined to disclose&nbsp;the details of what nonsense I've been getting up to.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So here's a disjointed-scrapbook-version.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426971262467-H3UBVYD0P0JSPDAHUPEG/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426971074560-QSKFCIX0MHONLCQKNZ4G/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426971229817-9DLZZ0CNXQXMR0TASYXI/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426970983463-MEET7KM0UM4IGPBUMHD4/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1426969586961-C0N4K1KZDTR0NTIDMXW4/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Plantation yielded unexpected but really precious solitary&nbsp;days full complete lack of obligations, which were spent reading and fraternizing with weird feline creatures and hanging out idly in a pool.

Along the crumbling shoulders of interstates that really aren't suited for biking, crossing over exit lanes not meant to be crossed, all while being doffed around by the wind and barely able to see. Mildly terrifying.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But it's those moments when I feel alive, to be honest.

No matter how much I've tried to preempt my own absent-mindedness,&nbsp;I've still managed to lose&nbsp;one thing at every stop.

Spent a couple nights sleeping in the floor of the&nbsp;geodesic library [below] that smelled of tree sap and had perfect acoustics; each morning I'd wake up to a couple hippies playing beautiful music in the center of the room as others sat around the edges and drank their coffee in reverence of the quiet mornings.

After the last month's overload of amazing people and hyper stimulation, I wanted a night to just sit. Get on the Internet. Be sober. Take a long shower. Order delivery pizza. &nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I didn't leave my room once.&nbsp;It was glorious.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The next day, started to push myself a bit harder. Decided in the morning I'd make it all the way to Charleston, 85 miles away, or run myself into the ground trying. My longest day till then had been about 47 miles.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Rode through miles of unmarked dirt road—got held up and lost a few times when those roads would suddenly end. Finally came upon a Wendy's, the one food option [or settlement of any kind] I'd seen in at least an hour of pedaling. Rode on through shoulder-less interstate.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My state of being alternated between being too physically tired or sore [it may be time, soon, to fork out for a better saddle than my $30 score...]&nbsp;to notice my psychological state, and being overtaken, suddenly, by a creeping sense of mortal terror, suddenly too afraid and cracked out on adrenaline to notice my physical state. I thought about venomous&nbsp;snakes in the tall grass, and about aggressive guard dogs, and about being stranded out in the boonies [I hadn't really thought ahead about just how remote some of the stretches I was riding along really were...I'd often be faced with the choice between extremely dangerous interstate and safer, quieter, but&nbsp;<em>completely</em>&nbsp;off-the-beaten-track dirt roads], about running out of water, about being hit by a car, yadda yadda.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My mood would spike in a moment of euphoria as I'd&nbsp;pass&nbsp;some beautiful&nbsp;swamp reminiscent of <em>Princess Mononoke</em>&nbsp;and think,&nbsp;<em>Man, you're gorgeous, but I'm a bit too worried about not dying to take a picture of you,&nbsp;</em>which would inevitably have me laughing out loud. A couple times I was overtaken by mysterious nausea and, unable to justify the source of it, began to feel a bit panic-attack-y, as semi-trucks shoved&nbsp;their way aggressively through the wind to get in front of me.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I hit a long stretch with no water, no signs of other people except maybe an odd hunting stand [which I initially thought were kids' playhouses], and&nbsp;I'd get tired, so tired my legs would kind of just stop working on their own without my conscious insistence at each pedal stroke to follow-up accordingly. But I knew if I stopped for another break, here, I'd never get back up. If I took a power nap here, I wouldn't make it to Charleston—I'd started the day without a plan for Charleston at all, but by noon a girl on WarmShowers had texted me saying she could host me, which gave me new motivation to get there, and not have to find some random hidden spot to sleep.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At one point I had a long stretch—several hours—where I didn't see another soul, another building, nothing. I began to ration my water, kicking myself for not having brought even more. I was running out of food, too, since I hadn't really needed to bring much with me at any given time until now.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Finally I saw the sign of a BP's gas station, and in my profound relief, I ran inside and spent $50 on snacks and drinks and protein bars, tripping over myself and dropping things the whole time. At a fucking BP's.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A man outside offered to watch my bike for me and chatted me up. Nice guy. Kept asking a lot of the same questions. I nodded emphatically as a substitute for conversation, as I shoved a ham and cheese sandwich in my mouth and glugged down a canned doubleshot. Every time I've just gotten&nbsp;off my bike, I'm not really ready to be human yet, but invariably people want to ask questions. I try to accommodate as best I can...but \"as best I can\" is not a whole lot, sometimes. Especially when someone starts in on a religious tirade, as my new acquaintance soon did.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">During that last leg of the day, when I was once again switched into&nbsp;\"too physically tired to be scared anymore\" mode, all my hypothetical fears that I'd been trying to push to the back of my mind came to a head. I was chased by a humongous dog and just barely managed to outpace it until it finally gave up. Shortly afterwards, I nearly ran over a huge rattlesnake as it was crossing the road.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And, fifteen miles from my host's house, I got hit by a car on the I-17.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">For the record, at least through South Carolina, the I-17 is a tightly-stretched, shoulder-less road. Every time [and there really weren't many times] an eighteen-inch-wide strip of asphalt jutted past the white line into the grass, an infatuated-schoolgirl-giddiness overtook me. I spent much of my time on it looking over my shoulder and bailing out into the dirt, just to be on the safe side. I have learned not to extend the slightest trust to drivers.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The car smashed into my front pannier and sent me over into the patchy, rumpled grass. I picked myself up and brushed myself off, too stunned to have any sort of an emotional reaction. I looked at my bike, and at myself. Not a scratch or a dent. Not even a small one. I wondered if I was in shock, and if maybe I was actually in mortal peril but my conscious mind was refusing to acknowledge it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">...Nope. I was fine.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The car, on the other hand, skidded&nbsp;over the lanes to its left, and then over the grassy median, landing there pointed one-eighty degrees from its former position. Not sure how I managed to send a car flipping around backwards, but hey.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway. Charleston could be a contender for my favorite US city. I don't typically like downtown bar scenes, but I liked the one there because people on the street were&nbsp;<em>friendly. </em>I don't mean crass or invasive. Just straight-up, open-smile,&nbsp;\"high five, homegirl,\" passing-by&nbsp;friendly. Re: my housing situation,&nbsp;I was in the company of a bunch of badass independent&nbsp;ladies all around my age,&nbsp;including one couchsurfer from Germany on a four-month solo excursion of the States. A bunch of us ran around Botany Bay on Edisto Island where we smeared clay all over ourselves.&nbsp;I reunited briefly with Kai, the teenaged cyclist I met back in Key West who, upon graduating high school in Oregon, decided to bike the <em>entire perimeter </em>of the Lower Forty-Eight. Which makes my own trip look kind of wimpy in comparison.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428354012202-NUKAUZXFZTQ371UDVCT2/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428354338239-YDC3HT1RP5MBFVHM01OC/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428354309702-NBDLKN1RCE53LLC89PGI/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428354027454-9NWY7JYHJH6I0MXYLP3P/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428354053934-DRXT69C2ATSESD9A2LE3/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428354040260-NH7TN8YU161SPMCIRM2N/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">After Charleston came another long stretch.

Instead,&nbsp;I traversed&nbsp;endless miles of plantation land and submerged swampland, riddled with some pretty aggressive \"Keep Out\"-esque signs [like, \"Whatever the camera doesn't get, the gun will,\" and so on] which had me a bit uneasy. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Eventually I got to an actual town and found a spot between two old brick buildings in a church, where I could just&nbsp;wedge my bike and my tent and pretty much be hidden from the road on all sides.&nbsp;I'd resigned myself to a thrilling night of trying to catch sleep in a sort of shifty place when my Conway host for the following night [<a href=\"http://anzhelikamodel.com\">Anzhelika Lewis</a>, a fellow model] called and insisted upon coming the rest of the way to pick me up, since I wasn't too far from her house by then&nbsp;and she said the town I was in was a bit on the sketchy side. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I deliberated a little bit, because I'd sort of just resigned myself to the night and was looking forward to being in a new situation that scared me. But I was also coming down with a pretty bad cough that I couldn't figure out.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">So she and her husband Rick came and got me, fed me well, and I passed out on the most luxuriously wide and rigidly bed-like couch I have ever slept on. Wound up being a good call, because all that night and the next day I had a persistent, painful&nbsp;cough-sneeze thing going on and could barely function [not a cold or flu, guessing it's a combination of allergies—particularly given that I've ridden long stretches through traffic—aggravating residual/chronic bronchitis, but what the hell do I know].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fortunately, I've gotten to recover over&nbsp;the last couple days&nbsp;by basking on the deck of a seventh-generation plot of family land [though: hmm, what do you think that means in South Carolina?] by the woods&nbsp;in my&nbsp;birthday suit, with a good book, with horses grazing in my periphery, drinking gallons of water and eating loads of Savannah Bee Company honey. Sadly, lots of allergy meds and cough medicine, too [both things I try to avoid taking except in dire situations].&nbsp;Such a well-placed extra bit of downtime.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And once I was feeling like a human being again, I did a last-minute shoot in Myrtle Beach&nbsp;involving hard hats and muscle cars and broken metal grinders and&nbsp;a four-foot long pipe wrench [mind out of the gutter].&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">With a certain perspective I could probably claim this was a tough week...but my luck's been through the fucking roof. In retrospect...really can't complain.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428635448030-BCDDM6E69CI1CJXEETPB/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428635351971-SJHTON09VL5UJVQITBSF/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428635253811-ZRR8S6WXNB6ME5GCEOF2/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428635691315-N2W6TLZRLSG9OE0AS9PH/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428635861871-RAMWZ7L2TYGHCTMRADRJ/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1428635789706-D2GX3PJQ3EQ4657JFO4D/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>",

We&nbsp;originally met at the Everglades Hostel in southern Florida for a night...then randomly bumped into each other on the street in St. Augustine a couple weeks later while I was engaged in an outwardly-zipped-up-but-under-the-surface-pretty-emotional parting with someone I’d grown really fond of fairly quickly [he then left me with her, and as he drove off Kevin mused, “Honey, you must leave a trail of broken hearts in your wake,” on which I offer you no commentary]. Serendipity, boom boom.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Kevin and I went out in the morning on my rest day in town, though the pouring rain sent her back home. I spent a day wandering around aimlessly in the rain on foot, singing and enjoying how ghostly the town appeared, off-season and on an off-weather day. I wound up on a dock, doing yoga, and then after assuring myself that Kevin's house [i.e., a warm shower and a bed] were within quick-sprinting distance of the dock, I&nbsp;impulsively jumped into the cold water, fully-clothed.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">But instead of running to Kevin's house once I climbed back out, I laid out on the dock and enjoyed a&nbsp;brief period of the numb chill, knowing it wasn't too cold. A bit of rain, a bit of a breeze, some muted sunshine peeking through to offer reprieve.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On what's been such a socially dense trip, I'd almost forgotten&nbsp;how high I get off slow chunks of&nbsp;solitude [granted, those come on a bike, too—but since I've started pushing myself to do longer days, I'm often just distracted by how much my ass hurts].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Went out on my own at night for some food, and [after I elbowed off some rather aggressively chauvinistic drunk military bros] wound up befriending Jim, the only other non-local at the one open diner [we picked one another out instantly as fellow aliens in what was otherwise a rather&nbsp;homogenized social scene]. Jim's&nbsp;been steering his boat along the Great Loop since his retirement a year ago, and we hung out and swapped travel stories for hours aboard his thirty-foot catamaran.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1430458663084-LL7M255PDDEUZQ38HVSQ/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1430458583724-5C447XD1I25YQ84XGORV/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1430458687654-X03Z0B1WYR65GROLTJJZ/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1430882550477-RFGNXLQ4UQ2W1NFDLXIP/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1430882631820-AM5XJ4WUGBC9LUEKUINU/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1430882325675-I2KJE8MJXYD0N8GFNQ9R/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1430882262532-HS3SG50XMZNUC6CZJW1E/Screen+Shot+2015-05-05+at+11.15.42+PM.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">From there I rode the ferry to Ocracoke on the Outer Banks, and for the next couple nights I mostly kept to myself, wanting to continue the trend of solitude I'd recently felt inclined towards. People often tried to stop me as I pedaled past, beseeching me with offers of hospitality or meals or drinks or rides, usually with open-hearted generosity&nbsp;[though with obnoxious and condescending&nbsp;persistence in one or two cases]&nbsp;but I'd smile and decline and continue. It felt important to put myself in a bubble for a couple days, for some reason [maybe because all the southern hospitality was keeping me perpetually drunk and I really needed to detox], and the Outer Banks felt like the perfect place to do it. Besides the single-serving friends I made for a few minutes at a time while on the ferries between islands, or when stopping to eat, I kept to myself.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I ninja-camped along the way in hidden spots.

In the middle of those five days I felt my body shut down entirely; my ass was sprouting painful saddle sores [over bruises, no less] and my brain was barely functioning, especially after a few terrifying jaunts over shoulder-less highways and bridges with fast traffic [as much as I've tried to avoid dangerous roads, I've found myself having to take them on occasion]. Oftentimes I've had to re-stock on food in gas stations, with no other nearby alternatives.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My body hates me a little bit, but it'll thank me once I learn to crush wine barrels with my legs.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In any case, that last fifty-mile day over rolling hills felt like a breeze...I've become so much stronger. At the beginning of this trip, fifty miles was the ceiling for how much I'd ride in a day on flat ground, and it would take me all day.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Anyway, I fell in love with Richmond at first sight [my hosts in Williamsburg had given me a great bike route for getting to it—riding through unpopulated countryside&nbsp;and small local farms, and then dropping around and down a hill, suddenly, to see the skyscrapers of RVA barely&nbsp;popping up ahead over a dense foreground of green].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I rode into the city, on a trail along the river, through grimy chunks of industrialization, past run-down warehouses and winding alleyways,&nbsp;under overpasses thick with seafoam-green-stained metal brackets and woven together so densely it felt like a fantastical subtropolis.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If ever a city has beckoned me to pursue some urban-spelunking...this one's got to be a goldmine. It brought the video game&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>&nbsp;to mind; a juxtaposition between anachronism and post-apocalyptic gloom. I absolutely loved it.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Bainbridge house instantly felt like home. In a span of a couple days,&nbsp;I wound up at a free vegan cooking class, getting a beer flight at a local brewery, enthralling the resident alley cat with my feet at night, wandering Carytown and eating gourmet cupcakes, naked lizard-rock basking and swimming in the warm river, watching <em>Red Dwarf</em> projected onto the huge blank white wall of the tall-ceilinged house, watching cage dancers at a local goth/fetish club, decompressing in my skivvies with a new book [<em>The Witch of Portobello</em>&nbsp;by Paulo Coelho, a gift from a friend I'd made in Charlotte] on the incredible back porch, eating amazing cheese steaks from the place next door.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The residents of the house all seem to be pretty busy and active people; I had the house to myself for good chunks of time despite there being six-or-so residents, and didn't even manage to meet all of them in the couple days that I was in town. The ones I did meet were supremely easy to fall into and out of socializing with, and&nbsp;I hung out with then in a revolving-door fashion...I'd be sitting on the back porch and one of them would come home, grab some chocolate milk or a beer or a cigarette, and sit on the back porch and talk to me for a while until it was time for either them or me to head off to whatever other plans we had next. When someone was free, they'd take me on a short adventure [i.e., most of the preceding paragraph], and drop me back off at the house when it was time for them to go to work or whatever else they had going on. Awesome people; before I even left town I already wanted to come back and visit again.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Also hung out a couple times with fellow traveling model <a href=\"http://www.modelmayhem.com/98824\">Rachel Dashae</a>, who is a total&nbsp;sweetheart and fucking adorable.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1431402059377-R5MU5DX2RKE6WSJCI3OZ/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1431402082971-KKLR2WFSDXH39IO4MJ0U/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1431402105227-X07G08USNN9HHFTCXUWA/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">From Richmond, rode on to Fredericksburg. Sixty miles on a hot day with a couple thousand feet of climbing,&nbsp;which&nbsp;I managed to do [on very little sleep] in the same amount of time that it had taken me to ride 35 miles on flat ground at the beginning of this trip, a couple months ago.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Everything's changed on this trip. My aptitude at coping&nbsp;with fear, fatigue, frustration, pain, discomfort, monotony. I feel infinitely more humble, and infinitely more confident. I'm not at a point where I feel I can even come close to doing any of my inner processes&nbsp;justice via&nbsp;blog entry [nor do I feel inclined to publicly share them, at least not any time soon, if ever], but this trip has changed my life in a pretty huge, unprecedented way.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And I'm still only just over halfway done. No idea what else is in store.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Fredericksburg is rounding out to a pretty balanced couple of days:</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Stayed with another Warmshowers host&nbsp;in an enormous house full of snakes [one of which may be getting named after me—quite an honor], with a six-story-tall yard made up of backyard terraces and a complicated system of wooden decks, shrouded in thirty species of tree...there's a bocce ball court waaaay down at the bottom of the terraces but you can't really see it from the house.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Got a couple shoots lined up—knocked one out today with <a href=\"http://www.modelmayhem.com/1160416\">Transient Photography</a>, who was absolutely lovely to work with and talk to, and am shooting tomorrow with <a href=\"http://www.modelmayhem.com/2671813\">Touched by Gray Photos</a>, who's been very well vouched for.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tomorrow I'm visiting my great-aunt; she's eighty-five and has broken her foot and could probably use some help around the house. It's been years since I saw her. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">And! Triumph! I finally succeeded at sleeping in, after weeks of failed attempts, which was probably facilitated by visiting a buffet after riding over from Richmond and, for the first time in my life, being able to make the most out of the all-you-can-eat factor...i.e., I had five full plates of food.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Good stuff.&nbsp;And I've got plenty of shoots and shenanigans lined up for once I get to the DMV!</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n       [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"533\"]<img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1431403402694-ADT0QQX7305LGSMB82ET/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\" Photo: Noisenest, Durham, NC \"/>  Photo: Noisenest, Durham, NC [/caption]",

Different-and-equally-awesome vibe, more of a polyamorous academic crew. The last couple days have been mellow and have largely revolved around conversation and food.&nbsp;Ate a squillion grilled veggies upon my arrival, then sat atop a roof shooting the shit with my new hosts and their neighbors as the sun set and unexpected fireworks popped up over the treetops. Went with a friend of a friend to Charlie Was a Sinner, a craft cocktail bar where the bartender obliged me by inventing new cocktails according to my preferences of the moment, and topped off with basil gelato.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1432778484501-OI4BWEYXAB90FVLEF47J/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1432778608503-RMSE4YVYM3HS4ZLJWCIC/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n\n  \n      <img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1432778556819-2IR870T5LR29MOS0GGEK/image-asset.png?format=original\" alt=\"\"/>\n  \n\n\n\n<div class=\"sqs-html-content\" data-sqsp-text-block-content>\n  <p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Figure model and artist&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.modelmayhem.com/1003576\">Katie Marie</a> came by and we hung out on the little \"porch\" ledge underneath the 4th story window of the Spruce Goose [the group house where I'm currently staying] as the soggy air crescendoed to what felt like a rolling&nbsp;boil [thankfully the heat burst into a small thunderstorm in the evening which has made the heat slightly more tolerable].</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It's kind of blowing my mind that this trip is 3/4 of the way done...now that the end is kind of in sight, I'm trying my best to remain present and not think in countdown terms, but exciting summer prospects in Reno are calling my name [i.e., as much as I told myself I wouldn't be part of a Burning Man project this year, or even go to the Burn at all...I'm going to be on crew for the Mazu project that's come from Taiwan via the Dream Community...it's an amazing project being run by an amazing crew, which includes many of the people I love and miss&nbsp;most in this world...along my travels I've met many people whom I adore, but very few whom I miss and whose absence I really feel].</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n       [caption id=\"\" align=\"alignnone\" width=\"1503\"]<img src=\"https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/537ae1d4e4b09aa32f55f8b3/1432777762343-7R4X0XJGP3MX0XJFJGNA/image-asset.jpeg?format=original\" alt=\" Photo: Robert Moran,&nbsp;Brookhaven, PA \"/>  Photo: Robert Moran,&nbsp;Brookhaven, PA [/caption]",

No idea why. So it goes.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I feel like the woman in <em>The Yellow Wallpaper</em>. I'm staying in a&nbsp;suburban neighborhood with pretty wooden houses. It'd be nice if I were more mobile—for the sake of my knee, I've been keeping off the bike and only cursorily wandering&nbsp;around the neighborhood on foot [I'm a bit of a ways from the nearest T station on foot].&nbsp;The greater Boston area's got a special place in my heart; in 2009 it was the backdrop for a paradigm shift that started&nbsp;me on the&nbsp;world-wandering, helter-skelter&nbsp;beginners-mind m.o.&nbsp;I've since committed ceaselessly to for going on six years. But in this particular instance I'm trapped by the needs of my damn meat-suit.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On this trip I've gotten an empirical, concrete look at degrees of separation. You know how sometimes you'll have an acquaintance or&nbsp;friend who introduces you to another friend of theirs, and then you and this new person hit it off and eschew the middleman?&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Right now I'm staying with&nbsp;a&nbsp;partner's ex-girlfriend's stepdad and we're having fascinating&nbsp;ideological conversations over dinner. And I only met said partner in the first place because of&nbsp;the vehement referral of a woman I briefly worked with when she found out from Facebook that he and I were both in Thailand at the same time and decided we <em>had</em> to meet each other.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There've been a lot of those, as far as my hosts go. I'll meet someone on this trip [by happenstance, or via Couchsurfing or Warmshowers,&nbsp;or because they're a client, or because they're staying at the same house I'm staying at], they'll set me up with a sibling or a friend or a coworker or a&nbsp;neice-of-a-former-coworker-of-a-friend-of-a-friend a couple states down the line&nbsp;if they think we'd like each other.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It's pretty cool.

That's when my knee started to complain, and consequently the seventy miles on flat were a lot more grueling than I expected.&nbsp;Once in Mastic Beach, I camped in the backyard of a couple's beach house and was treated to fully-from-scratch homemade pizza with truffle spread.

My compounded exhaustion was beginning to get to me—fifty miles had recently become so attainable, but when I got to the ferry I slumped into a bench and could barely move.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">My host had taken pity on me because of the weather and offered to come scoop me up from New London. The weather wasn't actually a problem—other than all the water in my eyes, I've kind of enjoyed my days riding through the rain, provided it's not too cold or windy—but my knee was beginning to feel a bit swollen and a lot worse.&nbsp;So, he came and got me, equipped with arnica cream.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">In the meantime, I had a brief look at New London, a place that had never been on my radar. I thought it was very cute, and had a good feeling about it [within seconds, I knew I liked it more than everything else I've seen of Connecticut]; I made a mental note that if I ever passed through again, I'd stop by for a bit.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Tom, my host, had gone out in his boat in the morning and harvested clams and oysters and caught a bluefish for tonight's seafood feast in Westerly, RI.

Hung out on the porch [onto which the words \"No Parents No Rules\" were inscribed], was offered many beers. Laid back in the bed of a truck and was carted&nbsp;to an underground show in an unmarked loft by a convenience store, whiling away the ride with a&nbsp;discussion of&nbsp;90's cartoons.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">I don't think I've met nicer kids in my entire life. Absolutely no pretense, no judgment.&nbsp;It was a rare situation where I was the only girl amongst a group of guys in their twenties...and felt neither dismissed nor idolized&nbsp;by anyone in any way.
